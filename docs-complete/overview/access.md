# Accessibility features

Accessibility features help users who have a physical disability, such as restricted mobility or limited vision, to use software products successfully.

HCL Digital Experience offerings use the newest W3C Standard, WAI-ARIA 1.0 to ensure compliance to US Section 508 and Web Content Accessibility Guidelines \(WCAG\) 2.0. The best accessibility experience is provided by using the newest release of the browser and the newest release of the screen reader. For more information, see the following URLs:
