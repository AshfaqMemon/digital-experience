# User interface components

In a default HCL Portal installation, the Dialog Stack and Dialog State Display portlets are deployed. The following topics describe how these portlets function.

-   **[Dialog Stack ](../screenflow/dlg_stck.md)**  
The Dialog Stack provides an overview of active and suspended dialogs. It allows for suspending, resuming, and canceling the dialogs.
-   **[Dialog State Display](../screenflow/dlg_st_dsply.md)**  
The Dialog State Display \(DSD\) displays a dialogs current state. You can move forward and backward or to jump to a dedicated step that was processed before. It is a generic navigation component that can be easily added to any page that participates in a dialog.
