# Drafts and projects 

You can create, update, and approve pages in a draft state, without affecting the published site. When you work with pages, you can edit pages as drafts, manage drafts with approval workflow, and then syndicate to publish changes.

The page structure is replicated in the site structure of a web content library. Due to this integration, you can add web content directly underneath a page with the authoring portlet and use the portal page as a site area for organizing your content. Syndication then publishes the page, ensuring that changes to the page and to its associated web content are published at the same time. Update pages in a draft state first. Drafts are organized within projects in Web Content Manager. When you publish draft changes to the published site, a project coordinates the updates and ensures that all drafts are published at the same time.

The following changes inside of the scope of a project to a page managed with Web Content Manager result in a draft that is not visible on the published site and is only visible within the project:

-   Any action that is run by using the toolbar, such as adding content to page, changing the page style, or changing the page layout.
-   Changing the access control that is granted to a page.
-   Changing the page properties.
-   Creating a child page.
-   Moving a page.
-   Deleting a page.
-   Changing the community or web content associations for a page.
-   Creating or modifying portlet wires for communication between portlets on the same page or on different pages.
-   Changing the portlet configuration with the **Shared Settings** mode of the portlet.

Changes to page draft elements result in either a new draft or an update to an existing draft. A page draft consists of the following elements:

-   The page item itself, including title, description, metadata, and properties.
-   The access control of the page.
-   The page layout.
-   Any public page wires that are connected to portlets on the same page or on another page.
-   Any portlet preferences that are defined in **Edit Shared Settings** mode.
-   The web content mappings of the current page.
-   The Vanity URLs of the current page.
