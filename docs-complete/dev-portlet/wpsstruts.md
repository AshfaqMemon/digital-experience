# Struts Portlet Framework 

Struts are no longer supported in HCL Digital Experience

The historical struts-based portlet frameworks are deprecated. Both the struts-based portlet framework based on the HCL Portlet API and the struts-based portlet framework based on the JSR 168 standard API are no longer available and are removed from support. Move all struts-based portlets that are based on this HCL framework to the Apache Struts Portlet Framework.
