# Overview of staging to production 

Review the topics in the overview section to understand all the requirements to successfully stage your production environment.

-   **[Staging to production process](../deploy/dep_ovr.md)**  
This overview provides information necessary to understand how to stage your portal to production from managing your configuration to team roles and portal solution release configurations.
-   **[Tools for staging to production ](../deploy/dep_tools.md)**  
You can use several tools to stage your server to a production environment.
-   **[Staging a virtual portal overview ](../deploy/dep_vp.md)**  
A virtual portal shares several resources with the main portal installation, especially all the code artifacts and the JVM. When you deploy a portal solution release to a virtual portal, these types of artifacts must not be deployed again.
-   **[Staging to production list](../deploy/dep_stage_check.md)**  
The items in the production list can be included in the staging to production Portal Application Archive \(PAA\) file. However, if you are not using the staging to production PAA file, use this list to determine the tools that are required to move your artifacts from the staging server to the production server. You can also use this list to determine what tool to use for the items not included in the staging to production PAA file.
