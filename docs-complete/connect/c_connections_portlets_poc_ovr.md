# Addressing HCL Connections content from a portlet 

Use custom URIs to identify, access, and display HCL Connections in a portlet.

HCL Digital Experience uses Piece of Content \(POC\) URIs to identify and address specific pieces of content in HCL Connections. Using a POC URI, you can precisely identify what content you want to display in a portlet. For example, when a user clicks a link in a blogs summary portlet, the POC URI identifies the blog content and displays it in the Blogs detail portlet. The URI specifies the identity of the content, not the location of the view of the document. The location of the view to the document is called the portal URL. The information that is contained in this URL is the navigational state.
