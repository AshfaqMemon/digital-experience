# Use and number of archetypes \| LikeMinds engine

Learn how to set use and number of archtypes to improve your LikeMinds Preference engine.

To generate recommendations for items that no mentors have rated, the Preference Engine uses synthetic users called "archetypes." These users possess a particular characteristic very strongly. For example, an archetype who only likes action movies might rate all action movies very highly. Recommendations from archetypes are added to recommendations produced by mentors.
