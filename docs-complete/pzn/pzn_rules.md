# Rules 

Rules are used to define how your Web site interacts with individual and groups of Web site visitors.

-   **[Actions ](../pzn/pzn_actions.md)**  
Actions use simple evaluation statements to select content to use or display, or to set information.
-   **[Profilers ](../pzn/pzn_profilers.md)**  
Profilers are typically used to categorize an individual \(usually the current site visitor\) according to his or her user properties.
-   **[Bindings ](../pzn/pzn_bindings.md)**  
Bindings combine actions and profilers to specify actions to perform when defined conditions are encountered. Returned content can be sorted or filtered prior to display or use. Actions can be set to be performed by always, exclude, and otherwise blocks. In addition, the total number of items used can be limited.
-   **[Recommend Content ](../pzn/pzn_recommend_content.md)**  
You use Recommend Content rules \(also referred to as recommendation rules\) to recommend content to your Web site visitors. Recommendation rules, powered by LikeMinds, recommend content based on users' past interactions with your Web site.
-   **[Visibility Rules ](../pzn/pzn_visibility.md)**  
Visibility rules determine what a user will see, or what has been targeted towards a user. Visibility rules can be assigned to pages and portlets and will be triggered automatically by the portal as needed.
-   **[Rule elements ](../pzn/pzn_rule_elements.md)**  
Learn about the options in the rule editor for the different types of rules.

View the prerequisites for creating an email action or promotion within the Personalization workspace.
