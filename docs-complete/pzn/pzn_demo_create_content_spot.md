# Create a content spot 

Use the Personalization Editor to create a placeholder for the rule that renders the selected content on a Web page. This placeholder is the content spot. Specify which rule to place in the content spot; this is called mapping the rule to the content spot or creating a rule mapping. In this example, the content is a resource collection.

Before you begin this procedure, ensure you have created the simple content rule Show Gold Offers for the Personalized Offers resource collection.

**Note:** You must use the same name as the original content spot's display name. Do not place the new content spots into a folder, unless your display name already includes slashes. Place them directly into the root Workspace.

1.  Return to the root directory in the Personalization Navigator.

2.  Click **New** \> **Content Spot** to display the Personalization Editor.

3.  Type Pzn\_offersSpot in the title field of the content spot.

4.  Select **Pzn\_offers** from the **Output Type** drop-down list.

5.  Click the button in the **Default Mapping** section.

6.  Expand the **Pers Offers** folder in the tree, select **Show Gold Offers** and click **OK**.

7.  Click **Save**.

8.  Test the content spot with the Personalization Editor portlet by selecting it in the Personalization Navigator and clicking the **Preview** tab in the Personalization Editor.

    **Note:** If the previous values appear on the Preview tab, the rule and content spot work.

9.  View the page with your Pers\_Offers portlet.


You can now edit the JSP file to contain dynamic code.
