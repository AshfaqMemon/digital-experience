# Finding users 

Use PeopleFinder or Directory Search to locate other WebSphere Portal users. The People Finder portlet can be added to a page through the Content menu, so that users can find people in any context. Directory Search is available to users as part of a larger task, such as sending mail. Directory Search also enables users to search for user groups in addition to individual users.

The People Finder portlet provides both quick search and advanced search options for locating people and information about people. Once found, a person is visible to other users as a person link that indicates online presence and displays a menu of instant messaging and other options.
-   **[Directory Search ](../collab/i_coll_r_por_dirs.md)**  
The Directory Search or "People Picker" portlet is a common embedded component that allows users to search for and select names of people \(individual users\) and groups for which the portal is configured.
