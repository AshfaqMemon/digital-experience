# Using the channel bar 

The channel bar displays the name of the feed category and the name of the feed subscription separated by a forward slash \(/\).

To display the channel bar:

1.  From the portlet menu, select **Personalize**, **Edit Shared Settings**, or **Configure**. The **General** tab is selected, by default.

2.  Click the **Appearance** tab.

3.  Depending on the presentation style in use in the HCL Syndicated Feed Portlet, click either the **Headlines** or the **Channel** link.

4.  Enable the **Override appearance defaults** check box.

5.  Enable the **Show Channel title bar** check box.

6.  Click **Save**.

7.  Click **Done** on the **Subscriptions** page.


The channel bar is displayed at the beginning of each feed when you view the feeds.

Besides providing a visual demarcation between consecutive feeds, the channel bar enables you to expand and collapse feeds.
