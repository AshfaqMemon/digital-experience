# Importing feeds 

To copy multiple feeds to HCL Syndicated Feed Portlet, use the import capability. By using this feature, you can import the feeds available as an OPML URL, to HCL Syndicated Feed Portlet.

You can use appropriate Outline Processor Markup Language \(OPML\) URLs to import multiple feeds into HCL Syndicated Feed Portlet.

**Note:** You cannot import feed xml files from your file system into HCL Syndicated Feed Portlet using the Import functionality. Importing of feeds is supported only when an appropriate OPML URL is specified.

Perform the following steps to import feeds:

1.  From the portlet menu, select **Personalize**, **Edit Shared Settings**, or **Configure**. The **General** tab is selected, by default.

2.  On the **Subscriptions** page, click **Import**.

3.  Specify an appropriate OPML URL in the **Enter a URL for the subscriptions to import** text field.

4.  Click **OK** to add the feeds specified by the OPML URL into HCL Syndicated Feed Portlet.

    The feeds are added to the **IMPORT\_FOLDER** feed category in the HCL Syndicated Feed Portlet.
