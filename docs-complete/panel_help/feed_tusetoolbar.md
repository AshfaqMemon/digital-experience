# Using the toolbar 

By enabling the toolbar, you can perform all the operations related to feeds and feed categories without leaving the view mode. Thus, you don't need to go to the Personalize, Edit Shared Settings, or the Configure mode to add, select, rename, reorder, re-categorize, and delete the feeds.

To display the toolbar:

1.  From the portlet menu, select **Personalize**, **Edit Shared Settings**, or **Configure**. The **General** tab is selected, by default.

2.  Click the **Appearance** tab.

3.  Depending on the presentation style in use in the HCL Syndicated Feed Portlet, click either the **Headlines** or the **Channel** link.

4.  Enable the **Override appearance defaults** check box.

5.  Enable the **Show toolbar** check box.

6.  Click **Save**.

7.  Click **Done** on the **Subscriptions** page.


The toolbar is displayed with a **My Subscriptions** link.

Clicking the **My Subscriptions** link displays the dialog box using which you can:

-   Subscribe to new feeds
-   Create new feed categories
-   Select feeds for viewing
-   Rename feed subscriptions and feed categories
-   Delete feed subscriptions and feed categories
-   Reorder and re-categorize feeds
-   View the feed settings

Use the **Close** link to close the dialog box.
