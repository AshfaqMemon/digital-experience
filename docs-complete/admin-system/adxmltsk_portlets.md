# Using administrative portlets for XML configuration 

XML configuration through administrative portlets allows you to export and import configurations. You can export a page or an entire page hierarchy by clicking the Export icon in the Manage pages administration portlet. You can also import an XML configuration file by using the Import XML portlet.

**Notes:**

-   You must enable support for JavaScript and disable pop-up blocking in your browser settings.
-   Do not use the administration portlets to export or import complete portal configurations. For details about how to transfer a complete configuration see the related reference information.
