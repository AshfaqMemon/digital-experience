# Analyzing portal usage data

You can collect data about the usage of your portal and analyze them.

You can collect these types of data:

-   Server side data of your portal site. This consists mainly of technical data internal to the portal.
-   Server side data of your HCL Web Content Manager items.
-   Data about the behavior of your client users. You analyze this data by using Active Site Analytics \(ASA\).

-   **[Logging and analyzing server side site data ](../admin-system/adsaconf.md)**  
HCL Digital Experience implements a logging function for your usage data. The portal writes usage records to a dedicated log file if site analysis logging is enabled. Multiple types of site analyzer loggers allow portal administrators to collect statistical data in various areas. The portal server manages the collection of data on its own, but from a business point of view you can also log custom details of business events. You can configure the portal for site analysis logging for the web content viewer.
-   **[Analyzing user behavior by Active Site Analytics ](../admin-system/sa_asa_work.md)**  
You can collect data about user behavior in your portal and send that data to a service for analysis. For this purpose the portal provides Active Site Analytics \(ASA\).
