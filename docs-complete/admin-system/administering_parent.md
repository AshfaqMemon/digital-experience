# Administering 

Use the administration tools that are provided with the HCL Digital Experience to do various day-to-day administration tasks.

## Overview

There are two methods for editing portal setup: using the administration portlets or the XML configuration interface.

The administration portlets are a convenient way to make real-time updates to the portal's configuration.

For more advanced administration, including batch processing of updates, administrator users are best encouraged to use the XML configuration interface.
