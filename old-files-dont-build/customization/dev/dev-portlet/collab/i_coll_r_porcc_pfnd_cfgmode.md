# People Finder configuration reference

The default fields of the People Finder portlet correspond to attributes defined by Member Manager, and enable the display of information about people in several views. As an administrator, you can determine the layout and content of portlet views by selecting and ordering the fields that appear in each view.

**Note:** If Member Manager is configured with Microsoftâ„¢ Active Directory, remove the fields carLicense, secretary, and pager from the People Finder configuration.

The configuration settings are stored in the file `apPDirConfig.xml`. You can return People Finder to its default configuration by selecting **Configure** from the portlet drop-down menu, and under XML Configuration, clicking **Reload Settings**.

For additional information on setting up the views of the People Finder portlet, while configuring People Finder, select Help from the drop-down menu on the portlet title bar.
