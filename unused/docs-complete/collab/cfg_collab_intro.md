# Integrate with collaboration software

HCL Digital Experience integrates with collaboration software to provide you with more effective and cost-efficient ways of accessing information, sharing ideas, communicating and working together. Key software that HCL integrates with includes HCL Domino, HCL Sametime, and HCL Connections.

-   **[Finding users ](../collab/collab_pfind_dirs.md)**  
Use PeopleFinder or Directory Search to locate other WebSphere Portal users. The People Finder portlet can be added to a page through the Content menu, so that users can find people in any context. Directory Search is available to users as part of a larger task, such as sending mail. Directory Search also enables users to search for user groups in addition to individual users.
-   **[Planning for collaborative servers and portlets ](../collab/i_domi_c_servers_plan.md)**  
Setting up a site with HCL Domino integration requires decisions about user directories, security, authentication, and performance. View some use cases that may help you make decisions leading to a successful Domino integration.
-   **[Integrating with HCL Sametime ](../collab/i_domi_t_sv_st_cfg_intro.md)**  
Configuring the Sametime Community Server and Sametime portlets requires a set of tasks performed on both the Sametime Community Server and the portal server.
-   **[Collaborative Services environment properties ](../collab/i_domi_c_csenvironment_props_intro.md)**  
If your collaborative site requires optional configuration that is not accomplished by the tasks that you run on the HCL Portal server to integrate IBM Domino and the collaboration products, you can modify the operation of the collaborative servers and portlets in various ways by manually editing the Lotus Collaborative Services environment properties file \(CSEnvironment.properties\) on the HCL Portal server.
