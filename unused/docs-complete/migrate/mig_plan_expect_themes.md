# Themes 

During the migration process, HCL Digital Experience moves your theme to your target environment without modifications. The pages in your target environment still reference the same theme that was used in the source environment.

If you are using standard portal pages, you must convert your pages to static pages. Then, create an HCL PortalVersion 8.5 theme and the layouts that are required for your pages to take advantage of the HCL PortalVersion 8.5 theme features.

For more information about preparing and optimizing your applications and themes for migration, read the planning section of the product documentation. Also, see the following related links for information about developing themes and skins, troubleshooting modular themes, working with layouts, and converting standard portal pages to static pages by using the HCL Digital Experience Page Migration Tool.
