# Supported specifications for inserting links to remote content

The federated documents feature enables you to retrieve information about documents in a remote repository and insert links to those documents in your web content. Several types of feeds are supported for accessing remote content.

The federated documents feature can access content from remote systems that support the following methods:

-   Content Management Interoperability Services 1.0 \(CMIS 1.0\)
-   Document Services remote interfaces, as supported by Lotus® Quickr®, HCL Content Manager, and FileNet® Content Manager
-   Atom feeds \(Personalization rules only\)
