# Online Help 

Online Help includes HCL Digital Experience information that is available from the product user interface. Online Help for both administrative and content author roles are also available. Help for the Configuration Wizard is also included.

**Note for Administrators:** Online help that you access from the HCL Help Center contains the most up-to-date information based on the most recent Combined Cumulative Fix. If you are not on the most recent Combined Cumulative Fix, access the online help from within HCL Digital Experience by clicking a **Learn More** link, **Help** in a portlet menu, the help icon in the banner, or the main help icon in the site toolbar. The online help that is built into your version of HCL Digital Experience contains the most up-to-date information based on the Combined Cumulative Fix that you are using.
