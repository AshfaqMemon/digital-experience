# Copying your theme 

Starting with Combined Cumulative Fix 08, you can now copy your theme by using the Theme Manager. You can also choose to copy your theme manually.

-   **[Creating a copy of your theme ](../dev-theme/themeopt_themedev_copy.md)**  
You can quickly copy an existing theme when you select the Copy option from the Theme Manager.
-   **[Manually creating a copy of your theme ](../dev-theme/themeopt_cust_copytheme.md)**  
You need to create your own custom theme by copying the Portal Version 8.5 theme before you start customization. You should create a copy of both the static and dynamic content even if you plan to modify files from only one. When you create copies of both your static and dynamic theme content, you ensure that your theme has all of the required elements that it needs to function. You also ensure that changes to any of the theme files in future Combined Cumulative Fixes do not affect your theme.
