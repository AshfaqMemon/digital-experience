# Editor and reviewer Access to the Script Application Library and Script Applications Site Area 

For a user or group of users that are not members of the `wpsadmins` group, who you wish to allow access to edit Script Applications and Script Application configuration, you can grant editor and reviewer access to those users for the Script Application Library and Script Applications Site Area. Users who push Script Applications must have these access roles.

-   **[Granting access to the Script Application Library ](../script-portlet/acc_lib.md)**  
You can grant editor and reviewer access to the Script Application Library to additional users or groups. Users who push Script Application instances to the server must have these access roles set for them.
-   **[Granting access to the Script Applications Site Area ](../script-portlet/acc_site_area.md)**  
The command line `sp-push` utility, when you push a Script Application that is not associated with a project, creates and approves newly created content. The user who runs a push requires both Editor and Reviewer role membership to run the push. By default, members of the `wpsadmins` group are both Editors and Reviewers, but you can specify extra users or groups.
