# Personalization REST API explorer\| HCL Digital Experience

The Personalization REST API explorer allows developers using the Digital Experience Personalization REST APIs to explore and test these APIs. The following topic presents the Personalization REST APIs available and how developers can use them working with the Personalization REST API explorer.

## Personalization APIs

Application of Personalization in Digital Experience solutions can support the ability to recognize a specific site visitor or also determine characteristics of a user based on previous purchases, products or pages viewed, or other attributes based on a user profile. Personalization then selects content that is appropriate for that profile.

For example, if a visitor belongs to a particular geographic region, targeted content specific to that region can be personalized to the visitor. If a person has a high salary range, region code, or other information, Personalization can be configured to retrieve information about a commercial website premium product. The page is assembled with the personalized information, and the visitor sees a personalized page.
