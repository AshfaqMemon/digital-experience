# Using WebDAV with HCL Portal

HCL Digital Experience provides a Web-based Distributed Authoring and Versioning \(WebDAV\) implementation that individual services can use by plugging into. WebDAV is a set of extensions to the HTTP protocol that allows you to collaborate on editing and managing files on remote Web servers.

Examples of such services are:

-   WebDAV for managing pages and static content.
-   WebDAV filestore. For example, this is used by portal themes.
-   WebDAV for Web Content Manager.

**Note:** WebDAV does not support secure connections, such as, HTTPS. For specific WebDAV client version compatibility, refer to the detailed systems requirements documentation and the topic *Using HCL Digital Experience File Sync*.
