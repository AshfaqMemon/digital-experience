# HCL Web Content Manager

Set up a content server by installing HCL Web Content Manager in various deployments to provide robust and flexible environments for web content development and delivery. After you install the content server, more configuration steps must be completed according to the role that the server plays in your web content environment.

Configuration for HCL Web Content Manager is managed through services that are defined as resource environment providers in IBM® WebSphere® Application Server. For each service, you can edit existing properties and add new properties through the WebSphere Integrated Solutions Console.
