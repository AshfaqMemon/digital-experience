# Using DAM extensibility

This section describes the DAM extensibility feature and how to configure your setup for extensibility.

DAM extensibility allows DAM to support user-defined custom renditions and transformations for images. This feature can be used to integrate with third-party plug-ins for custom asset processing, for example, to resize, crop, rotate, or other custom operations, and many more, while supporting default and custom renditions.
