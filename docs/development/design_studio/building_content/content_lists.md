# Content lists

The following section details information and steps on how to use content lists across your HCL Digital Experience site.

## Overview

In HCL Digital Experience 9.5 CF203, content lists are available in the elements panel. A content list is a dynamic list of content items based on search criteria. It allows the author to generate a dynamic list of content based on the **Authoring Template**, **Location**, **Categories**, and **Keywords**. Content lists are a WCM element type. You can drag and drop a content list to the canvas.

You can control how items are displayed in the canvas using filtering and sorting:

-   **Sort** - changes the order of the content items displayed. You can sort by **Title**, **Name**, **Description**, **Publish Date**, **Creation Date**, **Expiry Date**,**General Date One**, **General Date Two**, **Last Modified Date**, and **None**. The default sort is **Title**.
-   **Display order** - changes the content items by ascending or descending order. The default display order is ascending.
-   **Display limit** - limits the number of items displayed on a page. The default is 8.
-   **Start at** - sets the page number where the list starts on. The default is 1.

4.  Under **WCM**, drag and drop **Content List** onto the page.
5.  In the content list properties, search for the name of the content template to use. You can select the desired content template from the list shown.
6.  After selecting a content template, search for the location to use. You can select the desired location from the list shown. The locations shown on the list depends on the content template you selected from the previous step.
