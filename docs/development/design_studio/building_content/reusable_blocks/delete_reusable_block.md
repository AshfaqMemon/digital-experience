# Delete a reusable block

Learn how to delete a reusable block.

**Note:** Deleting a reusable block results in an error if the reusable block is being used in your current or other pages. Deleting a reusable block also results in an error if the reusable block has already been deleted by another authorized user. In this case the **Reusables** panel refreshes and updates the list of reusable blocks.

**Note:** In previous versions \(CF196 - CF201\), once you delete a Content Container in Page Editor mode, the Content Container is also deleted in WCM. However, when a Content Container becomes a reusable block and you delete it from Page Editor mode, it will remain in WCM.

1.  Open any page in Page Editor view.
2.  Click the **Reusables** panel to display the list of reusable blocks.
3.  Hover on the reusable block that you want to delete and click the delete icon.

4.  A confirmation modal appears. Click **Delete** to confirm deletion or **Cancel** to cancel deletion.

5.  A message appears if the selected reusable block is successfully deleted.
