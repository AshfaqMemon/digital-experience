# HCL LEAP

HCL Leap is an agile, easy-to-use tool that allows business users control over creating and deploying customer engagement applications and forms and transforming processes to be more efficient.
It allows you to easily create sophisticated web applications for data collection and process automation. Transform your business processes and be more efficient.

Build custom web application in minutes!
HCL Leap lets non-technical users (and technical too!) easily create sophisticated web applications for data collection and process automation. Applications are designed without writing code through a simple drag and drop interface.
When you deploy your application HCL Leap automatically creates its runtime which includes forms, database, reports, charts, API, rules, notifications, security, and workflow.
Easily build the application using drag & drop:

Any event, like opening the application, leaving a field, etc. may trigger an action, like updating an external application
Then manage the access control and configure the workflow and deploy to your site

## Easy to change
* Applications designed with HCL Leap can be easily changed to accommodate changing business requirements so you can be more responsive to customer and market needs
* Design changes can be made without interrupting the existing runtime or data collected
* When design changes are complete, they can be redeployed to automatically update the application runtime – all without any downtime for your users.

## Key Features
* Cloud-style deployment - Deploy a single software instance for all your users. Apps and data are secure and only accessible by those who created them and any others who they elect to have access. All use of the software is through your browser or mobile device.
* Simple workflow - Speed the approval process with flexible, role-based workflow and access control. You can automatically generate email notifications, invoke services at workflow steps and provide a dynamic experience based on rules. 
* Adaptive behavior - Applications you create can run on mobile devices and all the popular desktop browsers. Forms will adapt how they render to take advantage of the devices they are being used on.
* Everything you need - Design apps and make changes to existing apps in your browser. Deploy them and integrate in your sites. No need to worry about the database and reports and charts as these are all automatically generated.
* Flexible integration - Integrate data from existing systems to pre-populate fields and feed back-end systems with information you collect. The software’s service architecture lets you define connections with just about any connection.
* Extensible - Apps can be quickly customized using standard web development skills. Styles can be modified through CSS, functions added as HTML fragments and JavaScript can be used with the software’s comprehensive API and events.
