Teamwork makes the dream work - increase collaboration in the content review process - within workflows and across teams - at any stage.

Allow business users to create content templates and content easily. Here is an example of a content template where you can drag & drop and configure any element as part of content.

And content generated using this template. This maybe headless content or content used in DXM managed sites. You may include it in a workflow, versioning it, compare versions and restore any, and much more. It is integrated out of the box with HCL Commerce and Unica.

In DXM managed sites, you may use What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) editing.
It allows you to create, localize, and organize geo-specific content — and establish engaging international experiences — with out-of-the-box tools.
