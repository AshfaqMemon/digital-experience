# Site building

With HCL DX, you can combine [applications](application_integration.md), [content](content_management.md), and [assets](asset_management.md) into websites. You can use [personalization](personalization.md) and [role based access control](role_based_access.md) to ensure that your users receive an experience that is tailored to their needs and to your organization's security policies.

## Site building and editing

The Site Toolbar and Site Manager provide quick access to common content authoring tools and to a complete view of the site’s navigation. Without leaving the context of the website, content authors can create and modify pages and content items, create vanity URLs for promotions, auto-retrieve and adjust SEO tags, and more. By using the Site Toolbar, content authors and site designers use drag-and-drop simplicity to design, preview and publish multichannel digital experience sites.

From the Site Manager, you can access a customization shelf that contains applications and content that you can add to the page and access to configuration options. The same interface provides access to workflow and project capabilities.
