# Support Statement

HCL Software relies on a range of other commercial and non-commercial software (“Dependent Products”) to perform its function. This document describes the support that customers can expect for various configurations of HCL Digital Experience and Dependent Products.

HCL tests HCL Digital Experience with a defined list of Dependent Products during the development of a new release. However, we cannot reasonably describe all possible configurations that a customer might choose to use. HCL created this document to describe the level of support that customers can expect for various configurations of HCL Digital Experience and Dependent Products.

HCL only provides direct support for configuration and problem determination of Dependent Products that are explicitly supplied with HCL Products. In **all other cases**, it is your responsibility to obtain configuration assistance and support for Dependent Products yourself. In those cases, if HCL determines that a problem reported to HCL is caused by a Dependent Product, we will ask you to engage directly with your service provider to obtain support or assistance

!!! note 
    The statements in this document reflect the general level of support that can be expected for HCL Digital Experience, the terms and conditions of any specific support offering, license or other Agreement you might have with HCL will determine the actual delivered support for the product. Nothing in this document shall be construed as supplementing, modifying or superseding the terms of your HCL license agreement for HCL Digital Experience or any other agreement you might have with HCL, nor shall it create any obligation for HCL to deliver a level of support other than might be set forth in such Agreements.

## Categories of Support

For support purposes, we define three categories of configuration:

-   **Supported Configuration**

    A “Supported Configuration” is a combination of HCL Software and other Dependent Products (usually at a specified version, release, fix or specification level) that has been validated by HCL.
    
    HCL provides full support for configurations within this category. Support is provided under the terms of the product license, to ensure that the product operates within its specifications.

-   **Unsupported Configurations**

    An “Unsupported Configuration” is a combination of HCL Software and other Dependent Products (usually at a specified version, release, fix or specification level) that is known to not work with HCL Digital Experience and is therefore not supported.
    
    HCL does not provide support for Unsupported Configurations. Resolutions to deficiencies or incompatibilities found in Unsupported Configurations are not generally available.
    
    If business reasons warrant, customers can seek assistance on an additional fee basis from HCL services, from an HCL Business Partner or from another service provider.

-   **Other Configurations**

    Many configurations of HCL Products and other software exist that are not explicitly listed in “Supported Configurations” or “Unsupported Configurations”, but which can reasonably be expected to perform within the accepted bounds of reliability, function, and performance.
    
    Configurations that fall into this category typically substitute a Dependent Product listed in the “Supported Configuration” for similar software. This may be a newer fix level of the Dependent Product or another software product that adheres to a supported specification. For example, this could be a newer WebSphere® Application Server (WAS) fix pack, an LDAP server that adheres to that standard or an external security manager that integrates via public APIs.

    Customers may access HCL Support for “Other Configurations”. In these scenarios HCL Support will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide the same level of support as that provided for a Supported Configuration.
        
    During problem determination HCL Support will determine if the problem exists in a Supported Configuration, if a resolution can be provided, or if this is an Unsupported Configuration.
        
    Resources for problem determination are applied until HCL Support either provides a solution to the issue, determines that a solution is not commercially reasonable, or determines that the issue is caused by the substituted Dependent Product and does not exist in a Supported Configuration.
        
    If HCL Support is not able to resolve the problem on the customer configuration in question, then customers may choose to explore alternative solutions on an additional fee basis from HCL services, from an HCL Business Partner or from another service provider.

    One possible outcome of a problem in this category is that HCL determines the configuration not to work, and will update the list of Unsupported Configurations accordingly.
