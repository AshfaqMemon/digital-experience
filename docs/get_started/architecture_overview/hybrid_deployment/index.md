# HCL Digital Experience Hybrid On premises and Cloud components deployment   

This section describes how to install HCL Digital Experience 9.5 Portal Server and Web Content Manager services to on-premises platforms, operating with Digital Asset Management, Content Composer, Experience API deployed to cloud-based Kubernetes and OpenShift platforms deployed using the Operator (dxctl) method.

**Overview**

Many organizations are using cloud and containerized deployments as part of their overall systems environments. In parallel, organizations continue to operate software applications and processes on-premises. The HCL Digital Experience 9.5 Hybrid deployment reference architecture and topics describe an approach to deploy and manage HCL Digital Experience 9.5 core Portal Server and Web Content Manager services on premises, and connect to cloud native components Digital Asset Management, Content Composer, Experience API and related services in a production environment.

!!! note
    The hybrid deployment of cloud-based components HCL Digital Asset Management, Content Composer, and Experience API is supported on Red Hat OpenShift with the HCL DX 9.5 CF19 release. It is not yet supported with an on-premises clustered environment. The HCL DX hybrid deployment model will be supported on additional Kubernetes platforms in later release updates.

Virtual Portal support with Content Composer is not yet supported. Support for this component in a virtual portal deployment model will be available in later releases.
