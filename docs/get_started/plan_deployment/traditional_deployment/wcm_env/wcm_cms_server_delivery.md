# Web content delivery environments

If you only have an HCL Web Content Manager license, you can deliver your website without using HCL Digital Experience features.

## Pre-rendered delivery

Deploy a pre-rendered site when you are not using HCL Digital Experience features, such as portlets, and your content is static and updated only periodically. When you set up a pre-rendered delivery environment, your complete website is converted to static HTML files.

In a pre-rendered delivery environment, live items are syndicated from the authoring environment to the delivery environment. The content is converted into a set of static HTML files, which are then displayed to users through a web server.

## Servlet delivery

Use a website that a servlet delivers when you do not need to use portlet-based features such as authoring tools. In a servlet delivery environment, content is syndicated from the authoring server to the delivery server. The HCL Web Content Manager servlet displays the content. Site visitors access the site through a web server.

## Portlet delivery

A Web Content Viewer is a portlet that displays content from a web content library as part of a portal page. If your presentation is simple, a single web content viewer might be sufficient. However, you can also use multiple web content viewers to aggregate content from different libraries and provide a richer experience for site visitors. Use a local web content view portlet to display content only in your web content delivery environment.

In a portlet delivery environment, content is syndicated from the authoring server to the delivery server. It is displayed to users through a web content viewer portlet that is deployed on a portal server. When a local web content viewer is used, the web content viewer portlet is deployed on the same server as HCL Web Content Manager.

## Remote portlet delivery

You can use Web Services for Remote Portlets (WSRP) support in the web content viewer to display content on a remote HCL Portal server or cluster.

In a remote portlet delivery environment, content is syndicated from the authoring server to an HCL Web Content Manager server in the delivery environment. The web content viewer portlet is deployed on the HCLWeb Content Manager server. It is configured to communicate with the WSRP proxy portlet that is installed on a portal server in the delivery environment. Users view web content by accessing the proxy portlet on the remote portal server, typically through a web server.
