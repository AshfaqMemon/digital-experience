# HCL Web Content Manager \(WCM\) environments

Reviewing the Web Content Manager environments help you understand what happens in each environment and how you might want to set up your physical servers.

Each server or cluster in your web content system requires a separate data repository, but they would usually share LDAP. An HCL Web Content Manager system can be deployed in isolation or in parallel with an HCL Digital Experience system.

-   **[Web content system overview](../wcm/wcm_system_overview.md)**  
The type of web content system you deploy is determined by the size of your web content system, the type of website, and the number of users that create content, or view your web content.
-   **[Web content authoring environments](../wcm/wcm_cms_server_authoring.md)**  
An authoring environment is used to create and manage web content and is used by your content authors and website designers.
-   **[Web content testing environments](../wcm/wcm_cms_server_uat.md)**  
Testing environments can be as simple or as complex as a test environment used to test content, theme, application changes, and the delivery environment performance.

If you have a HCL Web Content Manager only license, you can deliver your website without using HCL Digital Experience features.
