# HCL Web Content Manager (WCM) environments

Reviewing the Web Content Manager environments helps you understand what happens in each environment and how you might set up your physical servers.

Each server or cluster in your web content system requires a separate data repository. However, they typically share LDAP. An HCL Web Content Manager system can be deployed in isolation or in parallel with an HCL Digital Experience system.
