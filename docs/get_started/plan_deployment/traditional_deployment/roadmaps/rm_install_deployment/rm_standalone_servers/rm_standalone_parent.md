# HCL Digital Experience stand-alone servers: Roadmaps

A stand-alone server topology is useful for many environments. Although the underlying topology is similar for many environments, the configuration steps to achieve a desired environment vary.

-   **[HCL Digital Experience demonstration environment: Roadmap](rm_demo.md)**  
A demonstration environment is ideal for running products, features, and application demonstrations. After installation, you have an Apache Derby database and a default file-based repository.
-   **[Portlet and theme development environment: Roadmap](rm_portlet_theme_dev.md)**  
This HCL Digital Experience roadmap is ideal for running a portlet and theme development server, which is used to develop and test portlets and themes.
-   **[Test or small production environment: Roadmap](rm_test.md)**  
A stand-alone server topology is ideal for a test or small production environment. In this roadmap, the web server, database, and user registry software are distributed to different physical servers.
