# Performance-sizing guidance for rendering with a small configuration

## DX rendering sizing-performance tests overview

DX sizing is one of the goals of DX performance tests. DX sizing aims to identify the reliable Kubernetes environment for small, medium, and large DX configurations. This topic presents the important KPIs (for example, number of concurrent users, average response time, and throughput) in small configurations. A similar approach will be applied for medium and large configurations. This topic also discusses how adjustments to the pod configuration can make significant improvements in system responsiveness.

This sizing work started with rendering scenarios of Web Content Management (WCM), portlets, and Digital Asset Management (DAM) with a rendering setup enabled in AWS/Native-Kubernetes. The Apache JMeter tool was used for performance tests.

## Conclusion

This initial performance guidance aims to understand how the ratios of key pod limits can improve the rendering response time in a simple single-pod system. Understanding these limits is an important step to do before you attempt to illustrate the impact of scaling pods.


- Changes to the pod limits for the following pods significantly improve the responsiveness of the setup and enable the system to handle more users.

| Pod name | Minimum number of pods | Container | Container image | Container CPU request and limit | Container memory request and limit |
| -------- | ---------------------- | --------- | --------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| core     | 1                      | core      | core            | 3000m                           | 5000Mi                             |
| ringApi  | 1                      | ringApi   | ringApi         | 500m                            | 512Mi                              |
| haproxy  | 1                      | haproxy   | haproxy         | 700m                            | 1024Mi                             |

- These modifications resulted in better response time and throughput by 50 percent. Detailed data are shown in the next sections.

## Customer rendering scenario details

| Concurrent users      | Existing WCM pages | Existing DAM content |
| --------------------  | ------------------ | -------------------- |
| Small  – 1000 users   | 20                 | 2k                   |
| Medium – 10000 users  | 200                | 10k                  |
| Large  – 100000 users | 2000               | 50 - 100k              |

## Environment

### AWS/Native Kubernetes
- An AWS Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance is running on a native Kubernetes platform with the DX images installed and configured.
- In AWS/Native Kubernetes, the test started with the minimal EC2 instance with a single node.
- The tests used a remote DB2 instance.

## Authoring details for small config in rendering sizing

- To perform rendering tests, the systems must be set up first. This section provides details of WCM, DAM, and portlets authoring.


## WCM Default Test Data - 20 pages

### WCM test data characteristics

- The default test data has a WCM design library called "PerformanceTestDesign" and five content libraries named "PerformanceTestContent01" to "PerformanceTestContent05".
- Each content library contains four levels of site areas, with four site areas per level. Only the 256 "leaf" site areas contain content.

- Each leaf site area contains ten content items, for a total of 12,800 content items across the libraries.

- Half of the content items are visible to "Anonymous" and "All Authenticated" users.

- The other half are visible only to members of ten groups per content item. These ten groups are spread out among the 500 groups assumed to exist in the test LDAP (and assumed to be called "Group0000" through "Group0499").

- Half of the content items (spread evenly over each type described previously) are profiled with the keyword "MENU."

- There are 20 test-portal pages created under the "PerformanceTest" label. Each has a URL in the form "<context-root>/perf/page-xx".

- Each page contains 6 WCM viewer portlets that show content below one of the 20 top-level site areas. For example, Pages 01 to 04 show content from site areas "SA01" through "SA04" in the "PerformanceTestContent01" library, and pages 05 to 08 show content from site areas "SA01" through "SA04" in the "PerformanceTestContent02"  library, and so on.

- Four of the portlets on each page show single-content items. For page 01, these are the first content items in site areas "SA01.01.01.01", "SA01.02.01.01", "SA01.03.01.01", and "SA01.04.01.01" respectively. Other pages follow the same pattern.

- Another portlet on each page shows a navigator of site areas and content items below the same top-level area.

- The final portlet on each page shows a menu of items and is scoped to the top-level site area. It also selects only those items profiled with the "MENU" keyword.

- A total of 99,999 users were added to openLDAP as authenticated users.

## DAM default test data: 2,500 assets

- Testers uploaded 2,500 assets. These assets include images (136kb, .jpg), documents (199kb, .docx), and videos (1.1mb, .mp4) to preheat. After preloading 2,500 assets, 15 assets were uploaded and rendered for 1 hour.

- Details of 15 assets were uploaded for rendering.
      
- There are 19 URLs in total, three of which are custom URLs, 8 are uuid URLs, and 8 are short URLs, which are combinations of original, tablet, smartphone, and desktop renditions.

| Asset    | Type          | Size                                      |
| -------- | ------------- |-----------------------------------------  |
| Image    | .jpg/png/tif  | 155kb, 2mb,5mb, 500kb, 100 kb, 2 mb,300 kb|
| Video    | mp4/webm      | 5 mb, 199kb,200kb , 2 mb,199kb            |
| Document | docx/xlsx/pptx| mp4- 1mb, 15mb, 100mb, webm- 2 mb         |

!!!note
      For DAM, only anonymous rendering is available.

## Pages and portlets default test data: 8 pages

Customers typically use a total of eight pages with portlets. To complete authoring and rendering both anonymous and authenticated users received access. The same users were added in openLDAP for WCM rendering. All authenticated users are assigned the User role.
 
As part of authoring, pages and portlets were added manually. The following list shows the details of portlets for authoring on every page:

- Page 1 - 2 Articles
- Page 2 - 2 Rich text
- Page 3 - Login portlet
- Page 4 - Information Portlet(JSR) - JSP file -  jsp/oob/welcome.jsp 
- Page 5 - Search Centre portlet
- Page 6 - Custom JSF portlet with simple form
- Page 7 - Script Application portlet --> Added JavaScript Functions, Date and Time object examples
- Page 8 - Added all above 7 portlets in this page

After users completed the authoring steps, the anonymous portal user and authenticated users (added to openLDAP) must render the pages. Every page request uses a `/GET API` call (for example, `/wps/portal/portletsperf/page1`) and there is a response assertion in a sampler to validate the content html in the response body. 

### Combined DX rendering of WCM, DAM, and pages and portlets

For rendering sizing, all rendering JMeter scripts of WCM, DAM, and pages and portlets are combined. See the following section for details of load distribution.

**Load distribution**

- WCM - 40 %
- DAM - 30 %
- Pages and Portlets - 30 %

## Pods in a native-Kubernetes deployment are 1:1 in small config

### Results summary

The following stages were conducted, starting with the default Kubernetes configuration.

#### Stage 1

- The DX combined rendering ran with default minimal deployments as mentioned in the following Helm values. 
- No issues were found with a user load of up to 500. 
- Errors occured at a user load of 600. This total number of errors is around five percent.<!-- five percent of what? -->

##### Observations

- For a user load of 600, there is an http response code: `503 service unavailable errors in test.`

- All errors are from WCM and pages and portlets, not from DAM.

- Total average response time increases exponentially with vload.

- Event loop lag for the Ring API pod is also on the higher end ( approximately 400 ms for a user load of 500).

- No pod restarts were observed.


#### Stage 2

From stage-1 observations, limits of core, ring API, and HA proxy pods were tuned one by one to see whether no errors occurred during a user load of 600.

See the following section for the tuned Helm values.

##### Observations

- No errors were observed and no pods restarted during the test.

- The total average response time, total throughput, and event loop lag for the Ring API pod improved significantly.

- The top five requests with higher response times are from DAM rendering and WCM inital page requests.
