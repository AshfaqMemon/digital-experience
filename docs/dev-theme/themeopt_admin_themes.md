# Managing theme capabilities 

You can administer the theme module framework. This includes deploying resources that can be cached, configuring capability filters, and disabling the automatic prerequisite loading feature.

-   **[Deploying themes with cacheable resources ](../dev-theme/themeopt_mod_adminmod.md)**  
Data sources are used in a portal to serve content. Some resources are cached and other resources can define cache settings and pass them to a data source. In a production environment, use caching. When debugging themes, disable caching.
