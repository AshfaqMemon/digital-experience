    Starting CF216, the Harbor repository is updated with an OCI-based registry and the Helm chart command is updated to be OCI-compliant. Instructions on how to pull Helm charts using OCI commands are now available. For more information, see the Help Center topics [Configure Harbor Helm Repository](../../deployment/install/container/helm_deployment/preparation/get_the_code/configure_harbor_helm_repo.md) and [Download and Deploy from HCL Harbor Repository](../../get_started/download/harbor_container_registry.md).

###  Notice of deprecation of automated Pod restart on ConfigMap updates

For development and testing when a ConfigMap is changed, you have to restart the appropriate Pod manually. For more information, see [Container configuration](../../deployment/manage/container_configuration/index.md#rollout-of-configuration-changes) and [Deprecated features](../deprecated_features.md).
