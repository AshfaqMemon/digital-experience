# Database source configuration

The rule-based user groups adapter uses a Java data source to communicate with the database that holds the table for the rule-based groups.

You must define a data source that references the required JDBC driver and points to the database that contains the groups table. For information about how to configure a data source, see the related links section.

Create the data source and, if you have a portal cluster environment, map it to the cluster scope.

Before you continue with the next configuration step, run the **Test connection** operation in the WebSphereÂ® Integrated Solutions Console and make sure that it runs successfully. Configure the rule-based user groups adapter later with the JNDI name of the data source. See the related links section for information.
