# Improving Portal Startup Performance

HCL Portal 8.5 has two options for reducing the time required to start the application server. These two
options are:

- Development mode: development mode is intended for software development and testing environments. It is not intended for use in high-load or production environments, as runtime performance may be negatively impacted in such environments.

- Portal light mode: light mode is usable in production or test environments. Startup performance is improved. In addition, most deployments will see some reduction in memory consumption.
