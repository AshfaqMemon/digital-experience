# Search

The following two caches are for internal usage and customers should not modify them. They are expected
to be very small.

**com.ibm.lotus.search.cache.dynacache.CacheServiceImp**
General purpose cache for search configuration objects, like search services.

**com.ibm.lotus.search.siapi.search.imp.propertiesScope**
Cache for resolved scopes.
