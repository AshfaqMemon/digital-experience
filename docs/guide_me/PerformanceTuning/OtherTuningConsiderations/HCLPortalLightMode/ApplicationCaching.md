# Application Caching

WebSphere provides built in functionality for caching Java objects, DynaCache. Custom portlets can use DynaCache and its DistributedMap interface to programmatically store and retrieve custom Java objects. This is especially useful for caching data from backed sources like databases or legacy applications.
