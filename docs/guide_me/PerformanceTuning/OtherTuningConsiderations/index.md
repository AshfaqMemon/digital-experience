# Other Tuning Considerations

In addition to the scenarios discussed above, HCL Portal has some other tuning options which may be
useful in some scenarios or when using specific features. These are documented here. Note that unless
explicitly overriding a base Portal tuning setting, the tuning previously documented in this chapter still
applies and will be required for optimal performance.
