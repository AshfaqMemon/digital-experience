# Theme Profile

In a profile_ctc_deferred.json file we evaluated, our test data had more than 3 levels of content in the page
hierarchy, and the primaryNav_overlay and secondaryNav_overlay modules were removed from the theme
profile. Removing these two modules improved response time and throughput, but the ability to hover
over a link and see all its children is not enabled. Without that functionality, it is necessary to click on the
link to see the children. It may also be necessary to leave these modules enabled for mobile sites.

See Portal 8.0 & 8.5 Theme Profiles for instructions on how to modify a theme profile.
