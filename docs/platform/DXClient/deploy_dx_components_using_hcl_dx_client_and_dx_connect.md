        <shortdesc>HCL Digital Experience (DX) 9.5 CF19 and later releases include a DXClient
            toolset, and DXConnect servlet that provides developers and administrators with an
            approach to deploy changes or improvements to the DX platform, and partially automate
            the development and delivery process.</shortdesc>
        <note id="note_wck_g11_nsb" type="important">DXClient version is mostly forward and backward
            compatible with the DX CF versions, however, in some cases it might not work as expected
            if the CF versions are different. Hence, ensure that the CF versions of both DXClient
            and DX Core are the same in your installation.</note>
