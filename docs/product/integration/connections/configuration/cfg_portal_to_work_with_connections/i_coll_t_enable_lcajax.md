# Set up Ajax proxy

The support for community pages uses the Ajax proxy to access the remote server. The Ajax proxy is updated for the base Connections URLS during the HCL Connections Portlets installation. If FileNet is used, you must still configure the Ajax proxy manually to update for FileNet. Configure the Ajax proxy so that direct requests that the CCM portlet makes to the FileNet server are allowed to pass through the proxy Server.
