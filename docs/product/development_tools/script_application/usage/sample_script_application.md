# Access the Sample Script Application on the HCL Github repository

Access and deploy the Sample Script Application as a standards-compliant Script Application in your HCL Digital Experience environment.

The Sample Script Application illustrates building an Angular CLI application and deploying it as a standards-compliant Script Application in your HCL Digital Experience environment. Since the sample application is platform agnostic, the same code can be run as a portlet or mobile app, allowing reuse over multiple devices and platforms. Access the application [here](https://github.com/hcl-dx/sample-angular-script-application).
