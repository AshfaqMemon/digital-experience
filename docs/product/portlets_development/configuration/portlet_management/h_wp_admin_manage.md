Manage the portlets and Web services that the site uses.

-   **[Managing Web modules](h_main_web_module.md)**  
You can install new portlets from either a Web service or WAR file, or you can manage existing portlets.
-   **[Managing portlet applications](h_main_manage_portlet_app.md)**  
You can enable a portlet application as a Web service and manage existing portlet applications. To view a list of portlets for a portlet application, select the appropriate portlet application title. You can also modify the properties of the portlet.
-   **[Searching](h_search_admin_portlets.md)**  
Use the search feature to search the portlet for portal resources by selecting the type of search and the appropriate search parameters. You can limit the number of portal resources that are listed in the portlet.
-   **[Checking the availability of a portlet](h_mport_test_portlet.md)**  
Check to see if a portlet is available so that you can add it to a page. This option appears only for remote portlets.
-   **[Providing a portlet through WSRP](h_mport_provide_portlet.md)**  
As a WSRP Producer, you can provide portlets through WSRP to Consumers. Consumers can then integrate these portlets into their portal remotely and use them.
-   **[Withdrawing a portlet](h_mport_withdraw_portlet.md)**  
You can withdraw portlets from being provided and being available through WSRP. Consumer portals can then no longer use them.
-   **[Copying a portlet](h_mport_copy_portlet.md)**  
Make a copy of an existing portlet.
-   **[Blocking or unblocking requests to a portlet](h_mport_plm_block.md)**  
You can block or unblock requests to a portlet. Usually you do this with portlets that Portlet load monitoring monitors. You can also check whether requests to a portlet have been blocked or whether the portlet can receive requests.
-   **[Modifying portlet settings](h_mport_modify_portlet.md)**  
Select the caching method for a portlet; add, edit, or delete a preference or parameter/value pair; or set locale-specific titles and descriptions for a portlet.
-   **[Deleting a portlet](h_mport_delete_portlet.md)**  
Delete a portlet from the portal.
-   **[Assigning access to a portlet](h_mport_access_portlets.md)**  
Click **Assign access** from the appropriate row, and use Resource Permissions to assign permissions to a portlet.
-   **[Configuring the Manage Portlets portlet](h_mport_configure_manage_portlets.md)**  
You can modify the search results of this portlet by selecting either **Edit shared settings** or **Configuration** from the portlet menu.
-   **[Fields for the Manage Portlets portlet](h_mport_fields_portlet.md)**  
Learn more about the fields that are provided with the user interface.
-   **[Configuring your portal for Web services](h_main_web_services.md)**  
If you want to make remote portlets available to your portal users, you can set up your portal for consuming Web Services for Remote Portlets \(WSRP\) and administer the necessary Producer definitions.
-   **[Web application bridge](h_wab_ov.md)**  
The web application bridge uses reverse proxy technology to integrate web-based content providers, such as the Microsoft SharePoint server, with HCL Digital Experience.
