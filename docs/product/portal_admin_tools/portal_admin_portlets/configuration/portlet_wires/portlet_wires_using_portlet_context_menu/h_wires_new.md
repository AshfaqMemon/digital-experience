Use the portlet context menu to manage wires when editing a page.

To manage wires for a portlet:

1.  View a page in edit mode.
2.  Select **Manage Endpoints** from the portlet context menu.

-   **[Adding a wire from the portlet context menu](h_wires_add_new.md)**  
Use the **Create** tab to define a new wire from the source event on the source portlet window and a target event on a different portlet window.
-   **[Deleting a wire using the context menu](h_wires_del_new.md)**  
The wires tab lists the existing wires that are heading away from the source portlet.
-   **[Defining global targets using the context menu](h_wires_setglobact_new.md)**  
Create wires between portlets on different pages. These special wires are called cross page wires. To indicate that a wire is a cross page wire, you mark the target event on the target portlet as a global target.
