A search element defines the layout of a form that is used to display search results. To use a search, you must create a search component. You cannot add search elements to authoring templates, sites, site areas, or content items.

To create a search component, open the applications menu and go to **Content** \> **Web Content Management** and then click **New** \> **Component** \> **Search**.

**Table of Contents:**  


**[Entering identification information](wcm_dev_items_id_searchcmpt.md)**  
Specify identification information for the current item, including the name and title for the item. The identification section is common to all item forms.

**[Specifying a location for an item](wcm_dev_items_location_searchcmpt.md)**  
When you create an item, you can specify the location of the item.

**[Creating a search results design](wcm_dev_elements_search_props.md)**  
The search element is used to define the design that is used to display search results.

**[Entering item properties](wcm_dev_items_props_searchcmpt.md)**  
Specify properties for the current item, including the location of the item and the list of authors and owners that are associated with the item. The item properties section is common to all item forms.

**[Granting users or groups access to an item](wcm_dev_items_access_searchcmpt.md)**  
Specify the access control settings for the current item to designate which users have access to an item and their level of access. The access section is common to all item forms.
