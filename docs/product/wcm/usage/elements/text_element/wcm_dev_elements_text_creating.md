You create a text component when you want to reuse a section of text in multiple places in your website.

To create a text component, open the applications menu and go to **Content** \> **Web Content Management** and then click **New** \> **Component** \> **Text**.

1.  [Entering identification information](wcm_dev_items_id_textcmpt.md)

When you create an item, you can specify the location of the item.
3.  [Entering text in the component](wcm_dev_elements_text_props.md)  
You use the text element to store some text in the component.
4.  [Entering item properties](wcm_dev_items_props_textcmpt.md)  
Specify properties for the current item, including the location of the item and the list of authors and owners that are associated with the item. The item properties section is common to all item forms.
5.  [Granting users or groups access to an item](wcm_dev_items_access_textcmpt.md)
