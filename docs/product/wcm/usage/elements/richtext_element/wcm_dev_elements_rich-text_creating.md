You create a rich text component when you want to reuse a section of HTML in multiple places in your website, and you want to use a rich text editor to create and edit the HTML. A copyright notice is an example of the kind of HTML you might store in a rich text component.

To create a rich text component, open the applications menu and go to **Content** \> **Web Content Management** and then click **New** \> **Component** \> **Rich Text**.
