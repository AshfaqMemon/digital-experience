When you add web content portlets to your site, you need to edit the settings of these portlets.

To configure a web content portlet, select one of the following options from the menu in the portlet title bar.

-   **Edit Shared Settings**

    Specify settings for all users of this instance of a web content portlet. Changes that you make in the **Edit Shared Settings** mode are not reflected in other instances of a web content portlet.

-   **Configure**

    Specify settings for all users of all instances of a web content portlet, regardless of the page on which the portlet instance appears.


**Note:** When the shared settings of a portlet are edited, the default **Configure** mode settings are not displayed on a page, even if you edit the **Configure** mode settings. To restore a portlet to the **Configure** mode, you need to delete the portlet from the page and add it back.

-   **[Authoring portlet settings](wcm_config_authoringportlet.md)**  
An authoring portlet is used to create and manage web content. You can edit the settings of an authoring portlet from within the **Preferences** section of the authoring portlet.
-   **[Editing the settings of a Web Content Viewer](wcm_deploy_delivery_local-rendering-portlet.md)**  
Use a local web content viewer to deliver websites that require the use of HCL Portal based features such as authoring tools.
