# FAQ content template

The FAQ content template contains fields for entering a question and an answer. The question is text and the answer is rich text.

The page template for this content type is unique in embedding the body of the content \(the answer\) directly into the list of FAQs. There is no FAQ details page, only the FAQ index page.
