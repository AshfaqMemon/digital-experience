# Create or edit a reusable block

Learn how to create or edit a reusable block on your site and its pages in HCL Design Studio (Beta).

## Create a new reusable block

Content containers with WCM Content Items are automatically created as **new** reusable blocks and are automatically added in the **Reusables** panel as soon as they are created, as shown below:

You can create a reusable block as if you are creating a new content container for your page.

1. To create a new content container, follow the steps in [Add a content item to a Design Studio (Beta)](../../update_content_items.md#add-a-content-item-to-a-design-studio-beta-page).
2. Access the newly-created reusable block in Page editor view, then open the Reusable blocks panel as shown below:

## Edit an existing reusable block

To edit an existing reusable block, follow the steps in [Edit a content item in a Design Studio (Beta)](../../update_content_items.md#edit-a-content-item-in-a-design-studio-beta-page).

!!! note
    Make sure the name of your reusable block is unique and identifiable for you to be able to quickly locate it from the list.
