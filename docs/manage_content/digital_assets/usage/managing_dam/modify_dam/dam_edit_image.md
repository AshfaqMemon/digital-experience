3.  Select and click any of the following **Edit** options:

    !!! note
        Some of the menu options are also available for video and document media assets.

    -   **Add to Favorites** \(the star located next to the image title and from the edit digital media asset selection\) - This can be used to sort and filter digital media assets from the HCL Digital Asset Management repository \(See [Manage media asset collections](../manage_collections.md)\).
    -   **Crop** - Extracts a region of the specified dimensions from the original image. You can crop the image using the resize handles \(freeform\) or by selecting a preset aspect ratio.
    -   **Rotate left**, **Rotate right** - You can rotate the image 90° counter-clockwise \(left\) or 90° clockwise \(right\).
    
        !!! note
            When editing assets in DAM, there is some expected variation in image size.
    
    -   **Replace** - Replace the digital media asset file with a new image media file.

        !!! note
            You can only replace the image with a new image of a supported image filetype. No other assets \(like document and video filetypes\) have the **Replace** option at the moment.

    -   **More** - Click to see additional actions available for the digital media asset.

        ![Edit > More options](../../../../../images/dam_edit_more_options.png)
