# Back up and restore a DAM

This topic shows how to backup and restore for Digital Asset Management (DAM) persistence and binaries. Refer [Back up and restore DAM](../../../deployment/manage/container_configuration/helm_dam_backup_restore.md)

This procedure is not meant for moving DAM data to another deployment. The backup data is valid only on the deployment where the backup is performed. This recommended approach for back up and restore is [EXIM](../usage/managing_dam/dam_exim.md).
