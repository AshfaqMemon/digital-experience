# Use reusable blocks

The following section details information and steps on how to use reusable content items across your HCL Digital Experience site.

## Overview

Users can reuse a content item multiple times across different pages of their HCL Digital Experience sites. Reusable content items are called *reusable
blocks*.

As of HCL Digital Experience CF203 and higher releases, the only reusable content element is the [Content Container](../use_content_containers.md). More content items will be introduced in future releases.

To access available reusable blocks, you need to be on the HCL Design Studio (Beta) Page editor and click the *Reusable blocks* icon as shown below:</p>

!!! note
    A reusable block is not made available or to be reused if it is already used in a page. For example, the three reusable blocks `Designer-Amanda Smithsen`, `Profile - Woodburn Studio` , and `Designer Contact Me` are not available for reuse in the said page as they are already in use:
