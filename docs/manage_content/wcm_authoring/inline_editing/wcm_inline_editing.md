# Understanding inline editing using Woodburn Studio

This topic provides an example of how you can use inline editing. This example uses Woodburn Studio, and you can perform the same actions in your own site. 

## Editing content in Woodburn Studio
Through inline editing, users with edit access can modify the content of a webpage.

1. Go to Woodburn Studio.

2. On the upper left corner, switch the Edit Mode toggle button to **ON**. 

    Going into Edit mode allows you to create and modify content.

3. Create a new project before performing any changes. Creating a new project ensures that all changes done are listed under that project and are subject to review and approval. 

    !!!note
        If you have Administrator privileges and you want to apply changes directly to the webpage, proceed to Step 4.

    1. Click the **Published Site** dropdown menu.

    2. Select **New Project**.
        This opens the **Projects Overview** window. 

    3. Under **New Project**, enter the name of your project.

    4. Click **Create**. 

4. Make your changes.
    
    !!!important
        If you did not create a project before editing, all changes made are automatically live in the external website. 

    With inline editing, you can:

    - Change the content of text boxes. You can click on a text box and it switches to an editable text box. In the example below, you can change the content of the **Headline-Text** box.
