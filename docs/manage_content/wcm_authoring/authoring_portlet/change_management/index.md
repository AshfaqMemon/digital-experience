- **[Restoring items in a library](wcm_managing_versions_library.md)**  
You can restore a set of items within a library that either have the same label or were versioned at, or before, a specified date and time.
- **[Labeling a set of items in a library](wcm_managing_labels.md)**  
You can apply a label to the most recent versions of all items in a library. This action does not create a version, it updates the label of the most recent version. If you created a label, you can later restore items in the library based on that label.
