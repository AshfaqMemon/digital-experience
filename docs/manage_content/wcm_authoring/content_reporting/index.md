# HCL Content Reporting

The HCL Content Reporting allows Content Managers to act on a huge bulk of items. (e.g. track and change expiry dates, replace images or words present in multiple content items).

Content reporting is for, but not limited to, the following sample use cases:

-  For when hundreds of contents are to be copied into a new site, making it easier to start using existing content instead of making new ones and just changing specific information.
-  For bulk updating:
    1.  Replacing specific words, phrases or images throughout multiple contents.
    2.  Updating keywords
-  For exporting to CSV for the use of the following:
    1.  To present a report of current contents
    2.  To present proposed updates to contents. (Via changes preview. See flowchart for high level info)-
