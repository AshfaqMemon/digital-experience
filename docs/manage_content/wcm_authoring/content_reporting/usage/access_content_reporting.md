-   **Search criteria options** - Search has been broken down into search criteria options to allow for a more flexible mix of search parameters.
e.g. Searching without defining a expiry date will simply search through all items. The respective dynamic fields of each criteria will be displayed upon selection. Content admin can perform content searching by any or all of these search criterias. which includes:

    -   **Expiry date** - This criteria will search for items are expiring from **From date** to **To date**. Filling up both date arenâ€™t mandatory and only one is needed to proceed. Entering only the From date will search items from that date onwards. Entering only the To date will search items from on and before that date. Entering the same date in the From and To dates will search that one specific date.

    -   **Owner** - This criteria will search for items are owned by provided owner/owners in owner criteria.

    -   **Author** - This criteria will search for items are authored by provided author/authors in author criteria.

    -   **Item type** - This criteria will search for any of the types included. All solo/parent and sub types are searchable.
    In case of user input of both a main item type and one or more of its sub types, (e.g. Component + Date + Image), the system should only fulfill the search of the sub-types. In other words, the most specific search criteria of the sub-type will be searched for since searching for the main item type will nullify the specific search. Below is the list of item types and their sub types.
