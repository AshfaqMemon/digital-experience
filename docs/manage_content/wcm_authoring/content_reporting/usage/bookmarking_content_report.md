# Bookmarking a generated report

Starting CF217, content managers can bookmark reports generated using HCL Content Reporting.

## Prerequisite

Content Reporting should be installed and configured to HCL Digital Experience 9.5 release update CF213 or higher. See instructions to install to supported container environments to the [Install HCL Digital Experience 9.5 Content Reporting](../installation/index.md) topic.

## Bookmarking a report

Refer to the following steps to bookmark a generated report:

1.  Log in to your HCL Digital Experience 9.5 platform and select **Web Content**, then select **Content Reporting** from the Practitioner Studio navigator.

2. Create a report on search items you want to bookmark. See the [Generating a content report](../usage/generate_content_report.md) for further instructions.

3. After generating a report, you can bookmark the page in your browser or copy the URL in the address bar to share the report.

## Automatic Refresh

Reports automatically reload when you switch tabs and then return to the **Content Reports** tab.
