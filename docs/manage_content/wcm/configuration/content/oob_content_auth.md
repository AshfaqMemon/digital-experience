HCL Web Content Manager includes a number of authoring user interface options. After the installation, the library explorer is the selected use interface. The provided options help you quickly get started.

You must be logged in as an administrator.

Selecting the user interface option is part of configuring the Web Content Management page. Here is an overview of the different options.

-   **Basic home page**

    The basic home page is designed for content authors who need to create content items and other simple item types. This type of user would not usually need access to the more advanced library explorer.

-   **Home page**

    This interface is designed for content authors who need to complete tasks such as creating content, editing their draft content and approving and declining content. This type of user would not usually need access to the more advanced library explorer.

-   **Launch page**

    You can develop a custom user interface, referred to as a custom launch page. Select launch page if you have a custom launch page.


1.  On the **Web Content Management page**, expand **Preferences** and click **Configure**.

2.  The content developers can access only the libraries that you add under **Library Selection**.

3.  Under **User Interface Options**, select the default view that you want. Experiment with the different views to determine which you like best.

4.  You can change the rich text editor too.
