# How to use authoring tools components in a Web Content Viewer

When rendering authoring tool components in the Web Content Viewer, you must account for some changes in the way placeholder tags are specified and in the way users browse to pages that contain authoring tool components. Authoring tasks that are accessed through a Web Content Viewer, such as inline editing, require the use of an instance of the HCL Web Content Manager authoring portlet that is reserved specifically for such tasks.

Authoring tools components that are rendered in a web content viewer allow you to create, read, edit, delete, approve, or reject content items directly in the web content viewer, instead of requiring you to browse to the HCL Web Content Manager authoring portlet to run the same action. The web content viewer either opens a window from the current page or redirects the user to another portal page that contains the authoring portlet.
