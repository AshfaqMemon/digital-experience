# How to store text and HTML

You use different types of elements to store text or HTML depending on the type of text or HTML being created.

**Tip:** Text that is common to all content that uses a single presentation template can be entered directly in the presentation template rather than separate elements.

-   **[Text, rich text and HTML elements](../wcm/wcm_dev_elements_text-richtext-html.md)**  
You use the short text, text, rich text, and HTML elements to store blocks of text, but each has slightly different properties.
-   **[Number element](../wcm/wcm_dev_elements_number.md)**  
You can store a numerical value in a number element.
