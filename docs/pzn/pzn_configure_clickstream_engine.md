# Configuring the Clickstream Engine

Learn how to configure the Clickstream Engine.

The Clickstream Engine generates recommendations based on a record of user shopping behavior as the user navigates through a Web site; that is, a history of user "clicks" during the user's website visit. It uses data such as the items the users view, click, and add to their shopping carts.

You can use the [User predictability](pzn_user_predictability.md) setting to specify recommendation behavior for the Clickstream Engine.
