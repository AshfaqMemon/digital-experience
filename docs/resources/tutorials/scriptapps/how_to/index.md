# How-To Guides

The following guides describe the steps on how to bundle and deploy DX Script Applications.

For DX pages with a single Script Application, there is an option to deploy the built application as a whole including its dependencies.

For DX pages with multiple Script Applications, it is recommended to deploy their common libraries/dependencies as one DX module and then  exclude them from the packaging and deployment of each application.
