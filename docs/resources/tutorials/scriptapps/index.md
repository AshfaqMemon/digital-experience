# DX ScriptApps How-To Guides

## Overview
The following guides will describe the steps on how to bundle, deploy and do simple event communications with DX ScriptApps.

For DX pages that will only have a single ScriptApp, an option is available to deploy the built application as a whole with the usual inclusion of its dependencies.

For DX pages that will have multiple ScriptApps, it is recommended to deploy their common libraries/dependencies as one DX module and then  exclude them in each of the application's packaging and deployment.

Each guide below will have their own sample bundler and deployment codes for reference.
