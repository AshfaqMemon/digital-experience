# DX ScriptApps How-To Guides

## Overview
The following guides will describe the steps on how to bundle, deploy DX ScriptApps.

For DX pages that will only have a single ScriptApp, an option is available to deploy the built application as a whole with the usual inclusion of its dependencies.

For DX pages that will have multiple ScriptApps, it is recommended to deploy their common libraries/dependencies as one DX module and then  exclude them in each of the application's packaging and deployment.
