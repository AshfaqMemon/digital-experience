# Integrating HCL Commerce with HCL Digital Experience

[HCL Commerce](https://help.hcltechsw.com/commerce/9.1.0/landing/wc_welcome.html) is a customizable e-commerce platform. It provides tools for business users to centrally manage a cross-channel strategy. With HCL Commerce, business users can create and manage marketing campaigns, promotions, catalog, and merchandising across all sales channels. 

With the [HCL Commerce integration with HCL DX](https://help.hcltechsw.com/commerce/9.1.0/integration/concepts/dx_introduction.html), you can utilize content and digital assets managed within HCL DX at any store. The integration provides the following HCL Commerce UI capabilities:

- Product Managers can work within the context of their merchandising tasks and are able to select digital assets for their products or categories.
- Marketing Managers can select content or images from HCL DX for use in Marketing Spots as part of their marketing rules.

The HCL Commerce integration provides a Reference Store application that retrieves specific content from HCL DX and renders presentation in the form of static and video ad e-Marketing Spots.
