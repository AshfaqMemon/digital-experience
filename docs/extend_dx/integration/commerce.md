# Integrating HCL Commerce with HCL Digital Experience

[HCL Commerce](https://help.hcltechsw.com/commerce/9.1.0/landing/wc_welcome.html) is a customizable e-commerce platform. It provides tools for business users to centrally manage a cross-channel strategy. With HCL Commerce, business users can create and manage marketing campaigns, promotions, catalog, and merchandising across all sales channels. 

With the [HCL Commerce integration with HCL Digital Experience (DX)](https://help.hcltechsw.com/commerce/9.1.0/integration/concepts/dx_introduction.html), you can utilize content and digital assets managed within HCL DX at any store. The integration provides the following HCL Commerce UI capabilities:

- Product Managers can work within the context of their merchandising tasks and are able to select digital assets for their products or categories.
- Marketing Managers can select content or images from HCL DX for use in Marketing Spots as part of their marketing rules.

The HCL Commerce integration provides a Reference Store application that retrieves specific content from HCL DX and renders presentation in the form of static and video ad e-Marketing Spots.

In addition, you can also use HCL Commerce as a headless commerce solution and integrate this solution into DX sites using REST APIs, namely [HCL Commerce REST API](https://help.hcltechsw.com/commerce/9.1.0/restapi/refs/restview_openapi3.html) and [Storefront REST API](https://help.hcltechsw.com/commerce/9.1.0/restapi/concepts/cwvrestapi_store.html). With this integration, business users (for example, Marketing Managers) can manage sites and landing pages easily with DX's What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) editing. Users can also add commerce capabilities to DX sites using drag and drop, accessible on all devices.
