# Integrating with Huddo Boards

Huddo is a team collaboration tool from the Huddo Boards that makes work easier. With Huddo Boards, users can view an activity as a board, giving them the option to drag and drop their **Tasks** and **Entries** and filter the content by person, priority, colour, and more. For more information, see [Huddo Boards](https://www.huddo.com/boards).
