# Managing community pages

Community associations associate a portal page with a community in HCL Connections.

-   **[Managing community associations](../admin-system/commpages_create_mapping.md)**  
You can create, view, modify, or delete community associations on a page with the Page Associations window, the XML configuration interface, and Portal Scripting Interface.
-   **[Creating community associations during page template instantiation](../admin-system/commpages_create_mapping_template.md)**  
When creating a page template, you can require that a community association is created when a page is created from the template.
-   **[Community associations and APIs](../admin-system/commpages_access_apis.md)**  
Although community associations are typically managed through the portal user interface, you might want to access the associations programmatically.
