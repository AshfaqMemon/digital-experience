# Portal user interface



Add pages to build your site, and customize its visual identity.

-   **[Managing pages](h_main_managing_pages.md)**  
Manage Pages allows you to create, edit, activate, order, and delete pages as well as external Web pages and labels. Available tasks depend on which item is selected. Each page can contain multiple pages. All pages on which you have the User or greater role are displayed in a navigation menu. You must expand pages to access nested pages. The options that you see are dependent upon your access level.
-   **[Managing themes and skins](h_main_themes_skins.md)**  
Control the look and feel of the site by changing the theme or skin. A theme controls elements of the overall portal, such as the banner and navigation. A skin controls portlet elements, such as the minimize and maximize icons and the title bar.
