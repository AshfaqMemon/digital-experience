# Managing themes and skins



Control the look and feel of the site by changing the theme or skin. A theme controls elements of the overall portal, such as the banner and navigation. A skin controls portlet elements, such as the minimize and maximize icons and the title bar.

**Note:** For HCL Portal Version 7 and later versions you need theme management rights to be able to create, update, and delete themes and skins. For details refer to the portal Help Center topics about access rights.
