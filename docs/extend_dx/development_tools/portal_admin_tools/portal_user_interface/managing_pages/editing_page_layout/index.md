# Editing page layout



The Edit Layout portlet allows you to add, remove, and arrange portlets on the page. You can also set column widths and select different page layouts. The tasks that you can perform may be limited if areas or content on the page is locked or you have insufficient access privileges.

A page is deactivated when you start making changes to it. While editing the page, all changes are effective immediately and cannot be undone or cancelled. Other users will not be able to access the page until you commit the changes by clicking **Done**.

-   **[Adding a portlet to a page](h_mp_add_portlets.md)**  
Portlets are added to the page by submitting a search and then selecting from the list of available portlets. Only portlets available in the portlet list can be placed on the selected page. After you place a portlet in a row or column, you cannot modify the row or column without removing all portlets from that outlined container.
-   **[Organizing objects](h_mp_organizing_objects.md)**  
Objects such as portlets and containers can be rearranged on the page.
-   **[Modifying page layout](h_mp_modify_page_layout.md)**  
When you create a page, you can choose one of the layout templates displayed. In most cases, you need only to add portlets to one of those predetermined layouts.
-   **[Editing portlet unique names on a page](h_uniquenames_inst.md)**  
You can change the unique name of a portlet on a page. The unique name that you set affects only the portlet instance on the page.
-   **[Changing portlet settings](h_mp_change_portlet_settings.md)**  
You can change the settings of each portlet listed in the Edit Layout portlet. These options are available from the drop-down menu on each portlet shown in the container.
-   **[Selecting a personalization rule](h_mp_select_pzn_rule.md)**  
You can manage personalization rules for a particular portlet from the Edit Layout portlet.
