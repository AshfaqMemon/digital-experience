# Managing page properties



Page Properties allows you to set the properties of pages, labels, and URLs. You can access Page Properties through context sensitive links or from the Manage Pages, Theme, Edit Layout, Appearance, or Page Locks portlets.

-   **[Creating pages using the Manage Pages portlet](h_mp_create_pages.md)**  
A page displays content, such as portlets and other pages, in a single area. By creating pages, you can organize your information and add new navigational elements to the site.
-   **[Creating shared pages](mp_create_shared_pages.md)**  
Use the Manage Pages portlet to set up the original page to be shared.
-   **[Creating derived pages](mp_create_derived_pages.md)**  
A page can be set to reference an existing page only during page creation.
-   **[Creating page templates](h_mp_create_page_templates.md)**  
To simplify the creation of pages, define pre-configured pages that can be used as templates when you create new pages.
-   **[Creating pages from a template using the Manage Pages portlet](h_mp_create_page_from_template.md)**  
Create new pages quickly by using a page template. Pages created from page templates contain pre-configured portlets and settings.
-   **[Creating a label](h_mp_create_labels.md)**  
You can create a label to act as a separator to organize pages and URLs.
-   **[Creating a URL](h_mp_create_url.md)**  
You can create URLs to add external URLs to your portal navigation.
-   **[Editing pages, labels, and URLs](h_mp_edit_pages.md)**  
You can edit the properties of existing pages, labels, and URLs to modify settings or add new settings in Page Properties. For example, you can change the name, navigational layout, and theme of a page from Page Properties.
