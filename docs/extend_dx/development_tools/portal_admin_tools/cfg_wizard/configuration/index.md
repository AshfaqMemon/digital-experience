# Configuration Wizard

Use the Configuration Wizard to set up stand-alone servers and new deployments, create clusters, migrate and update to new versions, and add new capabilities to existing deployments.

In the Configuration Wizard, you answer questions about the environment that you are configuring. Based on your answers, the wizard prompts you for custom values that are needed to configure your environment. Finally, the wizard generates custom steps and scripts to set up your environment.

## Configuration options in the Configuration Wizard

Using the following configuration options, you can configure the portal server that you are connected to in real time. You can also download scripts and instructions to run on other servers, create reusable scripts for common configuration patterns, and create scripts to compare to scripts created in previous releases.

## Configuration Wizard and clusters

In clustered environments, you can use the Configuration Wizard from the primary node. You can use the scripts from the primary node on the other nodes. You do not need to deploy the Configuration Wizard to the deployment manager.

## Configuration Wizard profile

The wizard has a unique profile, cw_profile, and administrator credentials.

!!!note
    Running the Configuration Wizard on z/OSÂ® is not supported.
