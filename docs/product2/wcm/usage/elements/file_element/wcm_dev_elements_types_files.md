# How to store files and images

You use these elements to store files or images.

-   **[File resource element](../wcm/wcm_dev_elements_fileresource.md)**  
You can store a file in a file resource element. You can then reference the file resource so that users can download the file by using a link or, for supported file types, convert the file directly to HTML and render it on the page.
-   **[How to reference a file resource](../panel_help/wcm_dev_elements_fileresource_referencing.md)**  
A file resource can be referenced within presentation templates and other element designs with either a component or element tag.
-   **[Image element](../wcm/wcm_dev_elements_image.md)**  
You store an image in an image element.
-   **[JSP elements](../wcm/wcm_dev_elements_jsp.md)**  
You use a JSP element to store a path to a JSP. When rendered within a presentation template or element design, a request to a JSP is generated and processed.
-   **[How to use stylesheets in items](../wcm/wcm_dev_style-sheets.md)**  
Stylesheets can be used to format the design of HCL Web Content Manager pages in the same way as normal web pages.
