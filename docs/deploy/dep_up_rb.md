# Updates using ReleaseBuilder

After setting up your initial staging and production servers, you can use ReleaseBuilder to make updates to your production server.

-   **[ReleaseBuilder](../deploy/dep_rbabout.md)**  
To generate or stage follow-on releases of HCL Digital Experience portals, configurations, and artifacts need to be moved between systems. ReleaseBuilder enables management of release configurations independent of user configurations.
-   **[Making updates with ReleaseBuilder ](../deploy/dep_releasebuilder.md)**  
You can use ReleaseBuilder to compare the XML configuration files that describe your staging server \(REV1\) and your updated staging server \(REV2\). You can also use it to create an XML configuration file that contains the differences between the two servers. You can then use this output file to import only the differences from your staging server \(REV2\) onto the production server. Features that are unchanged from \(REV1\) on the staging server \(REV2\) are not affected by the import.
-   **[ReleaseBuilder command syntax ](../deploy/dep_releasebuilder_cmd.md)**  
The ReleaseBuilder command file is in the wp\_profile\_root/PortalServer/bin directory and has the following syntax.
