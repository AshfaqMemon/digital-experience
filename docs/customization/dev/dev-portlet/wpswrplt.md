# Portlet creation basics

Get introduced to the concepts of portlet creation, starting with a simple portlet that is modified throughout.

For more information about the classes and methods that are used, read the concepts that are described in the portlet API. As you start to develop more complex portlets, make sure that you are familiar with the guidelines.

If you are developing a portlet that is provided as a WSRP service, refer to [WSRP services](../admin-system/wsrpc.md) and [Hints and tips for using WSRP with the portal](../admin-system/wsrpr_hints_tips.md) for information about the WSRP support in the portal.
