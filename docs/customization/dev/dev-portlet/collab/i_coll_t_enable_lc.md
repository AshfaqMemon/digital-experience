# Integrating with HCL Connections

HCL Connections portlets give HCL Digital Experience users access to additional collaboration and social networking features such as Activities, Blogs, and Bookmarks. Users can also view HCL Connections business card information and tags and link to HCL Connections features directly from the portal server.

The roadmap provides an overview of what you need to do to integrate HCL Connections and HCL DX. It also provides links to more detailed steps. Some of the detailed steps are in the HCL Connections documentation and some are in the HCL DX documentation.
