# Deploy DX components using HCL DXClient and DXConnect

HCL Digital Experience (DX) 9.5 CF19 and later releases include a DXClient toolset, and DXConnect servlet that provides developers and administrators with an approach to deploy changes or improvements to the DX platform, and partially automate the development and delivery process.

!!! note 
    DXClient version is mostly forward and backward compatible with the DX CF versions, however, in some cases it might not work as expected if the CF versions are different. Hence, ensure that the CF versions of both DXClient and DX Core are the same in your installation.
