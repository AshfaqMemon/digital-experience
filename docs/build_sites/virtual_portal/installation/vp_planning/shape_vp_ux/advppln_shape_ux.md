# Shaping the user experience

You can improve the user experience that users have with your virtual portals by using human readable URLs, or by using custom themes and skins for your virtual portals.

-   **[Human readable URL mappings for virtual portals](../admin-system/advppln_shpux_urlmap.md)**  
You can provide human readable URLs for your users to access their virtual portals. For example, you can give each virtual portal a human readable URL, such as http://www.ibm.com:10039/wps/portal/tivoli. You can pass the human readable URL of a virtual portal to its users. They can then use it to access their virtual portal.
-   **[Individual themes and skins for each virtual portal](../admin-system/advppln_shpux_thmskn.md)**  
If you expose multiple virtual portals on a single portal installation, you can give each virtual portal its own look and feel for the user experience.
