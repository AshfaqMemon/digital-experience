# Virtual portals

View information on how you can scope your HCL Portal to have multiple virtual portals.

Virtual portals can be of benefit if you want to serve multiple user groups by separate virtual portals for different purposes, but still want to keep your environment simple and limited to a single HCL Portal installation. Virtual portals allow a large extent of scoping and separating portal resources, user groups, and administration.
