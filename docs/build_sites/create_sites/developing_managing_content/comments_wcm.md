# Comments in WCM

Starting from CF213, the product contains a new solution that allows users to leave comments for Web Content Manager (WCM).
These comments can be used in Intranet scenarios or in controlled settings allowing external comments. 

## WCM Comments as Custom Plugin Component

Starting from CF213, WCM Comments can be enabled as Custom Plugin Component for a WCM content which can be rendered on page and Web Content Viewerâ€‹ Portlet.

This section describes how to enable, configure, and disable the WCM commenting solution as as Custom Plugin Component for a WCM content.

### Overview

WCM Comments is a feature that allows customers to enhance their presentation template by adding in a plugin for commenting. The actual comments are also stored in WCM and can be managed like regular content. You can choose which library is being used for storing the comments.

Note that this solution is not related to the existing comments for blogs/wikis ability.

### Enabling the comments plugin in WAS Console 

To make the comments plugin visible in the plugin component tag which should be added to presentation template, you must first add the configuraton in WAS Console. In WAS Console, go to **Resources > Resources Environment Providers > WCM_WCMConfigService > Custom properties > New Property**. Enter the following details:

- Name: enable.comment.plugin
- Value: true
- Type: String

!!!important
    After adding the configuration, a JVM restart is required.

### Adding Admin User Group Configuration in WAS Console for User Access Control (Optional)

By default, if the configuration for the admin user group is not present in the console, only users with manager-level access can delete comments.

For security purposes, if you need to limit the delete comments option to a specific user group, you must add the following configuration. In WAS Console, go to **Resources > Resources Environment Providers > WCM_WCMConfigService > Custom properties > New Property**. Enter the details below:

- Name: comments.admin.group
- Value: cn={user-group},o=defaultWIMFileBasedRealm
- Type: String

**user-group** can be any user group such as managers, admins, editors, etc.
