# Comments in WCM

Starting from CF213, the product contains a new solution that allows users to leave comments for Web Content Manager (WCM).
These comments can be used in Intranet scenarios or in controlled settings allowing external comments. 

## WCM Comments as Custom Plugin Component

Starting from CF213, WCM Comments can be enabled as Custom Plugin Component for a WCM content which can be rendered on page and Web Content Viewerâ€‹ Portlet.

This section describes how to enable, configure, and disable the WCM commenting solution as as Custom Plugin Component for a WCM content.

### Overview

WCM Comments is a feature that allows customers to enhance their presentation template by adding in a plugin for commenting. The actual comments are also stored in WCM and can be managed like regular content. You can choose which library is being used for storing the comments.

Note that this solution is not related to the existing comments for blogs/wikis ability.

### Enabling the comments plugin in WAS Console 

To make the comments plugin visible in the plugin component tag which should be added to presentation template, you must first add the configuraton in WAS Console. In WAS Console, go to **Resources > Resources Environment Providers > WCM_WCMConfigService > Custom properties > New Property**. Enter the following details:

- Name: enable.comment.plugin
- Value: true
- Type: String

!!!important
    After adding the configuration, a JVM restart is required.

### Adding Admin User Group Configuration in WAS Console for User Access Control (Optional)

By default, if the configuration for the admin user group is not present in the console, only users with manager-level access can delete comments.

For security purposes, if you need to limit the delete comments option to a specific user group, you must add the following configuration. In WAS Console, go to **Resources > Resources Environment Providers > WCM_WCMConfigService > Custom properties > New Property**. Enter the details below:

- Name: comments.admin.group
- Value: cn={user-group},o=defaultWIMFileBasedRealm
- Type: String

**user-group** can be any user group such as managers, admins, editors, etc.

## Render WCM comments in external components

Starting from CF214, WCM comments can be rendered in the external components like Page Components, Rich Text or Script applications etc. In this case, enabling and configuring Custom Plugin Component for WCM comments as described in the previous section is not required.

This section gives an overview about the page component shipped as a part of CF214 and also describes how to configure WCM comments in the external components like Rich Text Editor and Script Application.

### Overview on Custom Page Component for WCM Comments

Starting from CF214, the default WCM Comments library is shipped with a new custom page component, additional authoring template that uses newly added presentation template for rendering the WCM comments HTML markup component inside the newly added page component.

This section gives an overview on the components related to the newly shipped page component.

![Page Component accessible in Site Manager](../developing_managing_content/_img/page_component_in_site_manager.png)

#### Showing and Hiding Comments Page Component in Site Manager

For showing comments page component in Site Manager, we need to add a keyword with the value ```ibm.portal.toolbar.NewContent``` for Keywords property under the Profile section. Removing the keyword will hide the comments page component from Site Manager.

## Access Roles and Permissions for WCM Comments

Only authorized users can view, edit, and delete the comments in the library where the comments are stored. Also, the users should have atleast view access to WCM content library. For more information, see [Managing users and groups](../../../deployment/manage/security/people/authorization/controlling_access/managing_users_groups/index.md). 

The actions available for a user depend on their role:

- The **User** role or higher is required to see the comments.
- The **Contributor** role or higher is required to create comments.
- The **Manager** role or higher is required to delete comments. In addition to the Manager role, you can configure a specific group solely for deleting comments.

## Limitations

- Nested replies to comments are yet supported.
- Posting and replying are limited to 500 characters. 
- Rendering Comments outside the WCM rendering process (for example, from REST or a custom Servlet or JSP via the java WCM API) is not yet supported.

## Update global "Article" presentation template
