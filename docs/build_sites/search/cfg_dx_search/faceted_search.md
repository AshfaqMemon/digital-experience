# Faceted search

The provided Search Center portlet does not provide built-in support for faceted search. However, beginning WebSphere Portal 8, the Search REST service APIs are extended together with sample code for a search portlet which enable search facets. For more information, see [Search facets REST API specification](../search-rest-api/facets-spec.md).
