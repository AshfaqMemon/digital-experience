# Setting up DX Search

Refer to the following instructions to set up, configure, and administer a search service for your portal site:

1. If your Portal has multiple nodes, install and configure a remote search service.

2. Create a [search collection](portal_environments.md) (search full-text index).

    If you are using local search, a default, ready-to-run search collection is available.

3. Create content sources by [defining crawlers](recreate_standard_crawlers.md). 

Optional steps:

- Modify the [search user-interface](modify_dx_search.md).
- Modify the boosting settings for certain content fields (outside of the scope of this topic).
