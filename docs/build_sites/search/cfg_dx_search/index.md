# Configuring DX Search

End users of a Digital Experience (DX) site expect to see a **Search** box to find relevant information fast. To provide this functionality to users, administrators and engineers can choose from using DX Search or a third party search technology. This topic provides the steps to set up and configure DX Search, HCL DX's own search service.

Note that this document is sufficient to get started with DX search, but supplemental resources are required if you plan to set up DX Remote search.

## Decision tree for setting up DX Search

The following image outlines the steps to set up and configure DX Search based on the environment and search needs.

## Importance of setting up search

End users expect search functionality on every website that provides the information they need. Search services index the information on the site and allow your users to find the right information quickly.

There is a search component available with HCL DX that is free and well-integrated with the data generated by HCL DX.

If available, you can use a license for a third party search software. Consult the third party provider's documentation on support and integration with HCL DX for further details.

If you opt to not use DX Search, you can remove its configuration and resources. However, still note the disclaimer in [Integrating your own search engine](dx_search_integ_own_search.md) on related to having search available for content authors and editors.
