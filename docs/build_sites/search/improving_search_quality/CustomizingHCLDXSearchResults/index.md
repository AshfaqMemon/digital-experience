# Customizing HCL Digital Experience Search Results

The following are two options to change the look of search results in the HCL Digital Experience (DX) search center interface. The first is the display of search results and the second is the search term relationship.

- [Changing the search result display table](ChangetheSearchResultDisplayTable.md)
- [Changing the default search logic](Changingthedefaultsearchlogic.md)

In addition, you can also [manage the search query and results in Web Content Manager (WCM)](../../../../manage_content/wcm_authoring/authoring_portlet/content_management_artifacts/elements/search_element/index.md) and [use the Search API](../../search-rest-api/index.md) to build user interfaces.
