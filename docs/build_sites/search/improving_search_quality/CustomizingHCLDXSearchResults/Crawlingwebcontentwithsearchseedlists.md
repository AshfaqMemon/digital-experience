# Crawling web content with search seedlists

To improve the efficiency of crawling websites and associated metadata and to give content owners with finegrained control over how the content and metadata are crawled. The HCL Digital Experience (DX) and Web Content Manager Search supports the use of seedlists.

When crawling content is generated with HCL Web Content Manager, you can configure the DX platform portal to use seedlist support.

When you use seedlist with web content, the seedlist format 1.0 makes it possible to use the web content page type to render content that is found in the search results on the corresponding web content page. 

You can include custom metadata fields from a web content item that appears in the search seedlist but not in the HTML source.
