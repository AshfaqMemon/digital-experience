# Crawling web content with search seedlists

HCL Digital Experience (DX) Portal and Web Content Manager Search supports the use of seedlists to make crawling websites and their metadata more efficient and to provide content owners finegrained control over how content and metadata are crawled.

You can configure the DX platform portal to use seedlist support, when crawling content is generated with HCL Web Content Manager. 

When you use seedlist with web content, the seedlist format 1.0 makes it possible to use the web content page type to render content that is found in the search results on the corresponding web content page. 

You can include custom metadata fields from a web content item that appears in the search seedlist but not in the HTML source.
