# Adding External Search Results to HCL Digital Experience

You can present results from external web search sources to HCL Digital Experience (DX) end users using the External Search Results portlet.

The search engine service that you want to use must provide a web interface and return the search result as either an RSS or Atom feed. For example, the search result page which google would return is HTML-based and cannot be rendered within the External Search Result portlet.

There are two ways to configure external searches:

- Define external scopes that allow visitors to directly start external searches from the scope drop-down of the HCL DX search box. The search results display in a new browser window.

- Define an external search engine that contributes results to the Search Center results page. Site visitors see the external search engine results from the Search Center page in the External Results portlet.
