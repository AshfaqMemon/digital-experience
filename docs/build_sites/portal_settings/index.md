# Manage site settings

In this section you learn how to manage site settings.

<!---
-   **[Managing global settings](h_main_global_settings.md)**  
Define the settings for your portal server. These settings include the default portal language, the first page displayed when a user logs in, the option to set a URL for the Find feature, and what will be displayed when a user is not authorized to view a portlet.
-   **[Creating meaningful URLs for your site](h_main_url.md)**  
You can create constant URLs for portal pages that are easy to remember and therefore more user friendly. You can publish these URLs externally for users your portal users.
-   **[Managing custom unique names](h_main_custom_names.md)**  
The portal uses object IDs to identify portal resources unambiguously even between different portals. They consist of an extended alphanumeric string that might be difficult to remember. Portal administrators can use **Manage Custom Unique Names** to assign **unique names**, or human readable names, to portal resources. They can select names that can be easily remembered.
-   **[Managing markup languages](h_main_markups.md)**  
You can use Manage Markups to define the types of markup languages to be supported by the portal.
-   **[Managing client devices](h_main_clients.md)**  
You can define the types of devices that can be used to access the portal. Devices can include Web browsers on a personal computer, wireless phones, personal digital assistants, and other types. To optimize the data that the portal sends to the client and to handle the limitations and deviations of each individual client browser, the portal server maintains information about all supported client devices in a client registry.
-   **[Importing an XML configuration file](h_main_import_xml.md)**  
Use this portlet to import an XML configuration file from your local or network drive into a portal. --->
