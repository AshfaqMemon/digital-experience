You can add a URL for the search engine that your users can use in the portal.

Type the URL for the search engine that opens when a user selects **Find**.

**Note:** The Search box feature is available in the themes that are supplied with the portal. If you want to use your own custom themes, you need to implement the Search box. To do this, include the tag `<portal:find>` in your theme.
