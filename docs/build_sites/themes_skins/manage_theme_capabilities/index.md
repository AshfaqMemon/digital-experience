# Managing theme capabilities

You can administer the theme module framework. This includes deploying resources that can be cached, configuring capability filters, and disabling the automatic prerequisite loading feature.

Data sources are used in a portal to serve content. Some resources are cached and other resources can define cache settings and pass them to a data source. In a production environment, use caching. When debugging themes, disable caching. -->
