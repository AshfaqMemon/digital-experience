# Build Sites

HCL Digital Experience provides an array of features that provides a seamless experience in developing your business sites. These features are agnostic to the deployment methods, hence can work smoothly irrespective of whether your application is deployed on-premises as containerized and non-containerized, on Kubernetes, or on hybrid environments.

[Building Sites](/create_sites/index.md)
Setting up a website includes creating pages, adding navigation, setting up search, and adding content to the site.

[Themes and Skins](/themes_skins/index.md)
You can create themes using modules to contribute to separate areas of pages to provide flexibility, enhance the user experience, and maximize performance. To optimize themes on your website, use the theme optimization module framework. The framework separates feature-specific logic and capabilities from the theme code.

[Practitioner Studio](/practitioner_studio/index.md)
Practitioner Studio is a newly designed user experience for HCL Digital Experience. Please see the following pages to understand how the new navigation is organized.


[Site Manager](/site_toolbar_and_site_manager/index.md)
Site toolbar and site manager provide quick access to common content author tools as well as a complete view of your site's navigation. Without leaving the context of your website, content authors can create and modify pages and content items, create vanity URLs for promotions, and much more.

[Site Builder](/sitebuilder/index.md)
Site Builder is an application that you can use to create site templates or section templates for use with HCL Digital Experience.

[Woodburn Studio](/woodburn_studio/index.md)

[Mobile](/mobile/index.md)
The HCL Digital Experience platform presents mobile-enabled services support that enables you to deliver consistent, personalized cross-channel experiences quickly.


[Virtual Portal](/virtual_portal/index.md)
Virtual portals can be of benefit if you want to serve multiple user groups by separate virtual portals for different purposes, but still want to keep your environment simple and limited to a single HCL Portal installation. Virtual portals allow a large extent of scoping and separating portal resources, user groups, and administration.


[Search](/search/index.md)
Use the search feature to search for text that is displayed in websites that are created by HCL Web Content Manager and additional web sources integrated to your Digital Experience platform.


[Tagging and Rating](/tagging_rating/index.md)
Tagging and rating feature supports collaboration and interaction between users when using Web content.


[Site Analytics](/site_analytics/index.md)
Website analytics applications can be used to track user interactions with online channels. Web analytics integration with digital sites enables content authors, marketers and site managers to view and optimize the effectiveness of DX sites with target audiences and drive continuous improvements to the user experience.


[Social Rendering](/social_rendering/index.md)
HCL Digital Experience page editors can use social rendering to feature social data that is hosted on a remote HCL Connections server in the context of portal pages.
