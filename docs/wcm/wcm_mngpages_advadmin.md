# Administering managed pages 

You can run advanced administration tasks for managed pages, such as generating URLs for projects or working with projects by using scripts, or working with vanity URLs.

-   **[Project URL generation ](../wcm/wcm_mngpages_projectapi.md)**  
You can redirect request processing to a specific project by generating URLs with the ProjectIdentificationService API, or the REST API. Request processing operates either completely within the scope of a project or completely outside the scope of a project. You cannot switch projects during request processing.
-   **[Access control for managed pages ](../wcm/wcm_mngpages_access.md)**  
Access control for managed pages provides more capabilities than access control for standard portal pages. In addition to the access control features available for pages through portal administration, you can also apply HCL Web Content Manager features, like workflow and syndication, to access control.
-   **[Portal Scripting Interface and project support ](../wcm/wcm_mngpages_projectpsi.md)**  
With the Portal Scripting Interface, you can create Jacl or Jython scripts to automate the management of projects.
-   **[Portal Scripting Interface and web content libraries](../wcm/wcm_mngpages_librarypsi.md)**  
With the Portal Scripting Interface, you can create Jacl or Jython scripts to automate the management of web content libraries. Using the DocumentLibrary bean with the Portal Scripting Interface, you can create and delete libraries, retrieve a list of libraries, and retrieve library attributes.
-   **[XML configuration interface and managed pages](../wcm/wcm_mngpages_xmlaccess.md)**  
You can use the XML configuration interface \(XML Access\) to manipulate managed pages just as you can for other portal resources.
-   **[Lost-found site area ](../wcm/wcm_mngpages_lostfound.md)**  
When Web Content Manager cannot determine the proper location of a page item in the Portal Site library, the page item is stored in the lost-found site area. This site area ensures that you can recover pages and any content that is stored beneath the pages when a problem occurs.
