# What is new in tagging and rating 

With HCL Portal Version 9.5, the tag and rating widgets have been replaced by new enhanced versions of these widgets.

Before HCL Portal Version 8.5, tagging and rating provided two user interfaces with two different types of widgets:

-   The default portal tagging and rating user interface featured several elements: dialog widgets for tagging and rating, the tag cloud, the Tag Center, and a feature for browsing tags. The dialog tag and rating widgets opened in separate pop-up windows.
-   The alternative user interface provided inline widgets for tagging and rating. If you added such an inline widget to a portal resource, this widget was integrated into the portal resource. The user viewed the user interface for tagging or rating as part of the portal resource.

With HCL Portal Version 8.5, both the dialog and inline tag and rating widgets of previous portal versions are deprecated. They are replaced by a single pair of new enhanced inline widgets. They provide the functionality of both types of the old widgets. Users view them as part of the portal resource.

The new inline widgets have the following advantages:

-   The new widgets combine the functionality of the dialog widgets and the inline widgets of earlier portal versions.
-   With the new widgets, users can create, modify, and delete tags and ratings that they have assigned themselves. With the earlier inline widgets, user could only view tags and ratings. s
-   The widgets provided by HCL Portal Version 8.0 and earlier versions required Dojo support. The new widgets in HCL Portal Version 8.5 are light-weight, as they work without Dojo.
-   The new widgets provide easy and convenient access to various actions, for example switching between different scopes and viewing rating distribution.

To use the new widgets after a portal upgrade to version 8.5, you need to enable the widgets by running a configuration task. For more information, read *Enabling the new tag and rating widgets after a portal upgrade*.

In a default HCL Portal Version 8.5 installation, the new tag and rating widgets are enabled for specific profiles. You can enable and disable the new widgets for additional profiles. For more detailed information, read *Enabling and disabling the tag and rating widgets for additional profiles*.

The Dojo tagging and rating menu options of the earlier default widgets are still available in HCL Portal Version 8.5. They are enabled for specific profiles. You can enable and disable them for additional profiles. For more detailed information, read *Enabling and disabling the Dojo tagging and rating options for additional profiles*.
