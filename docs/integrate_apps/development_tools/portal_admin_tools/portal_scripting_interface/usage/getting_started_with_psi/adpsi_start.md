# Getting started with the Portal Scripting Interface

With the Portal Scripting Interface, you can administer your portal installation by executing commands. You can do that either interactively by typing the commands into a console window with interactive scripting and pressing the Enter key, or you can write the commands into a file and run that file. Here are some hints and examples for using the Portal Scripting Interface.

**Note:** To simplify things, the following examples are based on a Linux portal installation in the directory /opt/WebSphere. If you use a different system or a different installation path, adopt the examples so.

-   **[Opening a console window for interactive scripting](../admin-system/adpsi_start_opn_consl.md)**  
To start the Portal Scripting Interface from a console window, use the procedure described here.
-   **[Logging in to the portal](../admin-system/adpsi_start_login.md)**  
Before you can work with portal scripting commands, you need to log in to the portal server instance where you want to work with the Portal Scripting Interface.
-   **[Working with portal pages and other resources](../admin-system/adpsi_start_work.md)**  
The following exercise shows you some steps how to work with portal resources, such as pages and portlets, search for resources and information about them, and add a portlet to a page.
-   **[Getting help for a command](../admin-system/adpsi_start_help.md)**  
The Portal Scripting Interface provides more commands and variants of commands than shown in the previous topics. To learn more about these commands and their syntax and function, and beans and parameters, refer to the integrated help of the Portal Scripting Interface.
-   **[Logging out of the portal](../admin-system/adpsi_start_logout.md)**  
After you complete working with the Portal Scripting Interface, you log out and exit the interactive scripting console.
