# Manage pages portlets

Use Manage Pages to create, edit, activate, order, and delete pages and external web pages and labels.

Use the Manage Pages portlet to complete the following tasks:

-   Create, reorder, delete, and edit the properties of pages, labels, and URLs
-   Reorder pages, labels, and URLs
-   Assign access to pages, labels, and URLs
-   Move pages to a new location in the portal hierarchy

Available tasks depend on which item is selected. Each page can contain multiple pages. All pages on which you have the User or greater role are displayed in a navigation menu. You must expand pages to access nested pages. The options that you see are dependent upon your access level.

Both administrators and users with appropriate access can create and delete pages. Users can delete only the pages that they create or the pages for which they have at least Manager access. User can create pages from the site toolbar.

-   **[Pages and page types: derived and hidden pages](../admin-system/mp_page_types.md)**  
Understanding the behavior of derived pages, and hidden pages, and the differences between them can help you manage pages and create the correct type of page for your needs.
-   **[Selecting pages](../admin-system/mp_select_pages.md)**  
 Pages that you can modify in Manage Pages appear as links in a table. By clicking a link to select a page, you can navigate to other nested pages to perform page tasks. You can also select labels and URLs in Manage Pages.
-   **[Using friendly URLs](../admin-system/mp_friendly_url.md)**  
You can associate friendly URLs with portal pages and labels. You and your users can use these friendly URLs to access specific portal pages or labels by using a human readable path, which is easy to remember.
-   **[Task refresh-page-layout](../dev-portlet/csa2r_cfgtsk_rfrshpglyt.md)**  
Use this configuration task to refresh the page layout for all pages assigned a given page layout template.
-   **[Customizing pages](../admin-system/admcustom.md)**  
The page customizer contains portlets for editing the layout, content, and appearance of pages. It also provides the Wires portlet, which allows users to set up connections between cooperative portlets on a page, and the Locks portlet, which allows users to lock and unlock containers and container content. You can configure the settings for these portlets to show a certain set of functions, restricting basic users from performing more advanced tasks.
