# Configuring portlet applications or portlet parameters

Many portlet applications and portlets have associated configuration parameters that must be changed after deployment. Manage Applications and Manage Portlets allow you to modify configuration parameters.

The original configuration is determined by settings in the `portlet.xml` deployment descriptor file. Configuration changes apply to each specific instance of the portlet. HCL Portal does not validate configuration modification to portlet applications. Some of the portlet parameters can be configured in the portlets themselves by using the portlet modes.

For instructions about the tasks and detailed steps for changing configuration values refer to the **Manage Applications** or **Manage Portlets** helps.
