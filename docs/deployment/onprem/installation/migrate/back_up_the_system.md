# Backing up the system

Make sure that you have a current backup and recovery policy before you alter the source environment. Follow the instructions in the Backup and restore section to ensure that you cover all the affected assets.

Before you start the migration, make a fresh backup of your environment. At a minimum, you must back up the following information:

-   Databases
-   Directory structures of the source environment
-   Security configurations
