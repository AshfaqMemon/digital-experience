# IBM i: Preparing your operating system

Prepare the operating system to ensure a successful installation.

1.  Make sure that you have a CD drive.

2.  Make sure that the server is in an unrestricted state.

3.  If you do not have one, create a valid IBMÂ® i user ID and password.

4.  Create a user profile with a user type \(user class\) of `*SECOFR` \(other than QSECOFR\) to install and configure HCL Digital Experience.
