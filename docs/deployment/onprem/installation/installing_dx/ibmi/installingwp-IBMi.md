To enable document preview function for HCL Web Content Manager and the Common Mail portlet, you must set up an HTML rendering server to work with HCL Digital Experience. Because IBM i does not contain native graphics support, you must install extra fonts to run the document conversion that is required by these functions. Document conversion enables HCL Digital Experience to convert documents that are produced by commonly used office programs into web pages so that they can be viewed and searched by users online. The additional fonts include an HTML rendering server that is known as X virtual frame buffer for the X server.
