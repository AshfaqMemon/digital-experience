# Changing your site URL

You can change your site URL during and after installation to create URLs that are more reflective of your site and easier to remember. If you entered a different value for the context root during installation, there are additional steps that must be performed to implement the new context root value in your site URL. If you decide to change your site URL after installation, you can use the Configuration Wizard to remove the context root and default home values \(/wps/portal\) from your site URL or to change these values. You can also use the Configuration Wizard to remove or add navigational state information to your URL.

The instructions that you follow in this section depend on whether you changed your context root during installation or whether you want to change your site URL after installation.

**Limitation:** If you removed the context root, the HCLWeb Content Manager Commerce Integration linking and editing function does not work.

-   **[Completing the context root change started during installation](../config/cfg_intr_inst.md)**  
If you changed the context root on the **Configuration for HCL Portal: Profile configuration details: Advanced** pane during installation, there are more steps to take to complete the change.
-   **[Changing the site URL after an installation](../config/cfg_intr_seo.md)**  
After you install HCL Digital Experience, you can change the portal site URL to create a shorter or more human-readable URL. Use the new option in the Configuration Wizard to remove or change the context root and default home \(/wps/portal\) values in your site URL. You can also select an option to remove or add navigational state information from your site URL.
