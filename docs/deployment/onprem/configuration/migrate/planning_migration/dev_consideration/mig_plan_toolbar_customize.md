# Supported toolbar customization

In Version 8.5, only specific customizations are allowed for the HCL Digital Experience site toolbar. Only the supported toolbar customizations can be migrated to the new version.

If you plan on migrating a customized, modularized Version 8.0 theme, review the [Preparing the site toolbar](../dev-theme/themeopt_themeshelf.md) section to understand what customizations of the toolbar are supported.

After you migrate your data, you can choose to enable the Version 8.5 toolbar, and remove the Version 8.0 toolbar on your modularized Version 8.0 theme. See the "Enabling new functionality" section of the documentation to enable the new toolbar or remove the older toolbar.
