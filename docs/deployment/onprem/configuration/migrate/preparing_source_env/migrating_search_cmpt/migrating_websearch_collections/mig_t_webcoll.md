# Migrating web search collections

You migrate web search collections to HCL Digital Experience 8.5 by exporting each web search collection from the earlier portal and then importing the web search collection into the new portal. You can also use the same functionality to move web search collections to a production portal after verifying them on a test portal, or to move web search collections to a configuration with remote search after verifying them locally on a portal.

-   **[Exporting search web collections](../migrate/mig_t_export_webcoll.md)**  
Use the Manage Search portlet to export search web collections from a source portal. Before you export a collection, make sure that the user who is running the portal application process has write access to the target directory location.
