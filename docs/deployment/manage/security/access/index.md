-   **[Working with resource permissions](h_main_resource_permissions.md)**  
You can control whether a resource propagates or inherits its role assignments, assign roles explicitly to specific users and groups, place resources under the control of an external security manager or bring externalized resources back under the control of portal, create or delete roles on externalized resources, view inherited role assignments for specific users and groups, and modify resource owners.
-   **[Managing permissions for users and groups](h_main_ug_permissions.md)**  
View and modify the access rights that users and user groups have for resources. Access rights are determined by role assignments.
-   **[Managing credential information](h_main_credential.md)**  
Credential Vault holds credential information and allows portlets to access the credentials to provide single sign-on authentication. Credential Vault allows you to add and manage vault segments and resources as well as managing system and user vault slot. You can create a vault slot for each known application in the portal that requires access to secure resources.
