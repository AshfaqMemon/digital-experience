# MacOS: Configuring a developer mode environment

While WebSphere does not support to run natively on MacOS and therefore you cannot run DX either natively you can run DX in Docker
on MacOS. To turn on developer mode you can follow the Linux instructions to enable and disable developer mode.

For developing portlets and other applications you will need the IBM JDK 8. It can be installed via IBM Installation Manager.
In case you are running a non intel processor like M1 or M2 we recommend to use the Rosetta emulation to use the regular IBM JDK.
