# Collecting analytics data

Before you can send data about user behavior in your portal to a service for analysis, you need to collect that data. See the following topics for information about how to do this.

-   **[How Active Site Analytics data is represented in the portal](../admin-system/sa_asa_data.md)**  
The data for the analysis of user behavior is retrieved from markup embedded in the portal pages.
-   **[Writing an aggregator for Active Site Analytics](../admin-system/sa_asa_cust_script.md)**  
You can write your own scripts to retrieve the data for Active Site Analytics from the portal themes and skins and connect to your analytics service provider. Such scripts are called aggregators.
-   **[Adding an Active Site Analytics aggregator to a portal page](../admin-system/sa_asa_add_aggr_2_page.md)**  
Portal administrators can manage the aggregators. They can assign an aggregator to one or more portal labels or pages.
-   **[Instrumenting a theme for Active Site Analytics](../admin-system/sa_asa_use_theme.md)**  
The Tab menu - Page Builder Page Builder portal theme provided with HCL Digital Experience is prepared and suitable for use with Active Site Analytics. You can also enhance the other portal themes or create your own custom theme to use the Active Site Analytics functionality.
-   **[Configuring an aggregator at run time](../admin-system/sa_asa_cfg_aggr_runt.md)**  
If you want to configure the behavior of an aggregator at run time, you can pass additional meta data values to the aggregator.
