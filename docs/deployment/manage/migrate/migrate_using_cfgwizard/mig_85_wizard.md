# Migrate data using the configuration wizard

For Version 8.5, data, applications, databases, property files, security settings, and configuration are migrated using the Configuration Wizard. Use the roadmaps for cluster and stand-alone environments to guide you through the process.

See the *Roadmaps for migration* section of the product documentation, and choose the roadmap that is specified for your environment for details on using the Configuration Wizard.

For the z/OSÂ® platform, the new version must be on the same server as the earlier version. Migration to a different \(remote\) server is not supported. In addition, migration for the z/OS platform cannot be completed using the Configuration Wizard.
