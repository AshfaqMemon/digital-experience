# Creating and deploying a differential release

Create a differential release of your existing Portal Application Archive \(PAA\) file. Then, deploy your changes to your production servers. Use Syndication to move HCL Web Content Manager content to your production servers.

1.  [Creating the differential release](../deploy/dep_diff.md)  
To update your Portal Application Archive \(PAA\) file, you must create a differential release from your source server.
2.  [Deploying the differential release](../deploy/dep_deploy_diff.md)  
After you create the differential release PAA file, you can install and deploy your differential release to the production servers. If you have a cluster, install and deploy on the primary and secondary nodes of the cluster.
