# Installing HCL Digital Experience

HCL Digital Experience provides flexible deployment options that range from proof-of-concept where you can examine and test functionality to a highly available and scalable production environment. Review the planning information to learn more about hardware and software requirements, high availability, scalability, supported topologies, and much more. Select your operating system and then select the installation pattern that most reflects your business needs.

1.  [Planning to install HCL Digital Experience](../plan/plan_installation.md)  
Before you install HCL Digital Experience in a production environment, assess your hardware and software needs, possible database configurations, security options, and LDAP server options.
2.  [Roadmaps to deploy your HCL Digital Experience system](../install/deployment_patterns.md)  
Review the roadmaps to understand the common deployment, configuration, migration, and integration patterns.
3.  [Migrating to IBM WAS 9.0.5](../was/ug_instwas95.md)  
If you are installing the latest version of HCL Digital Experience, migrate your IBM WebSphere Application Server to 9.0.5.
4.  [Installing the prerequisite software](../install/prereq_software.md)  
Before you install HCL Digital Experience, make sure that the prerequisite software is installed, configured, and has the required fix packs applied.
5.  [Installing the HCL Digital Experience software](../install/inst_web_experience.md)  
The HCL Digital Experience is designed to help create, manage, simplify, and integrate your processes into an engaging online experience.
6.  [Installing add-ons](../config/int_sol_installer.md)  
 You can use the Solution Installer through the Configuration Wizard to install and uninstall add-ons to an HCL Portal server instance. The Solution Installer uses the Portal Application Archive \(PAA\) format as the standard format for application distribution. Portal Application Archive \(PAA\) updates are not supported in the Configuration Wizard currently. For more information about updating add-ons using a command prompt, see the Managing your existing PAA file section.
7.  [Uninstalling the Digital Experience software](../install/uninstall.md)  
Uninstalling the digital experience software is a multiple step process and the method you use is dependent upon your configuration. Removing HCL Portal in a single-server configuration is different from removing HCL Portal from a cluster. Manual uninstallation instructions are provided for a single-server configuration in case of an error situation.
