# Uninstalling the Digital Experience software

Uninstalling the digital experience software is a multiple step process and the method you use is dependent upon your configuration. Removing HCL Portal in a single-server configuration is different from removing HCL Portal from a cluster. Manual uninstallation instructions are provided for a single-server configuration in case of an error situation.
