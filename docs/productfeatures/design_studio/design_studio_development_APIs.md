# Web Content Manager Open Standards REST APIs

This topic provides access instructions for the Web Content Manager Open Standards based Digital Experience REST APIs (Beta). The API design for this version of the WCM DX REST API is intended to facilitate the creation of Web Content Manager, also Design Studio (Beta) assets.

## Web Content Manager Open Standards REST APIs

The API design for version 2.0 of the WCM DX REST API is intended to leverage the open standards format of the [Experience API](https://help.hcltechsw.com/digital-experience/9.5/open_api/openapi_overview.html) and facilitate the creation of Web Content Manager, also Design Studio (Beta) assets.

!!! note
    The Web Content Manager Open Standards DX Beta code changes are possible until finalized and delivered in a later HCL DX 9.5 release for production use.

After installing HCL Digital Experience 9.5 CF196 or higher release, the Open Standards REST API may be accessed at `/dx/api/wcm/v2/explorer`.
