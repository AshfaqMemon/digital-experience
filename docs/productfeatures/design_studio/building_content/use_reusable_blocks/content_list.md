## Deleting a content list

!!! notes
    - Deleting a reusable block results in an error if the reusable block is being used in your current or other pages. 
    - Deleting a reusable block also results in an error if the reusable block has already been deleted by another authorized user. In this case, the **Reusables** panel refreshes and updates the list of reusable blocks.
    - In previous releases (CF196 - CF202), once you delete a Content Container in Page Editor mode, the Content Container is also deleted in WCM. However, when a Content Container becomes a reusable block and you delete it from Page Editor mode, it will remain in WCM.

To delete a reusable block:

1.  Open any page in Page Editor view.

2.  Click the **Reusables** panel to display the list of reusable blocks.

3. Hover on the reusable block that you want to delete and click the **Delete** icon.
