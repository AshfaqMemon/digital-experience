You can create a new portal page by starting with a static HTML file or an HTML fragment. If you revise the HTML, you can refresh the page to render the changes in the portal.

To create a new portal page, first create an HTML file and save the file to your local computer. The static HTML file can contain references to portlets. You can also include other resources as part of the page, such as Cascading Style Sheets or graphic images.
