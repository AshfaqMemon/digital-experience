# Using the XML configuration interface to work with Producer definitions

You can use the XML configuration interface to work with Producer definitions in different ways.

If you use the XML configuration interface to create a Producer definition, you can work online or offline. Depending on these scenarios, you must consider some differences.

You can also use the XML configuration interface to export a Producer definition, and to create a Producer definition and consume a portlet from that Producer by using a single XML script.
